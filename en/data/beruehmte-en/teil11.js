        <p class="krim-portrait-subtitle">German TV host &amp; former handball professional, born 1976 in Kiel &ndash; Animal correspondence: Beaver</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Beaver</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Beaver</strong> is the animal of the social Seven &ndash; it doesn't build for itself alone, but creates structures and formats that serve a broad public, and it's rarely satisfied with just one project. Alexander Bommes has hosted several regular television formats in parallel for years &ndash; a restless simultaneity that reflects exactly this beaver nature.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Alexander Bommes was born on January 21, 1976, in Kiel, and played handball from a young age, first in his hometown club's second-division team, then from 1999 in Germany's top handball league for TSV Bayer Dormagen and from 2001 for VfL Gummersbach. Alongside his active sports career, he began studying law in Kiel in 1997 &ndash; pursuing two demanding paths at once was, for him, never a contradiction but the normal state of affairs.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Social Seven: From Professional Sport to Service for the Public</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Naranjo called the <strong>social Seven (SO7)</strong> <em>Sacrifice</em>: it gives up its own immediate enjoyment in favor of a larger cause. At the end of 2007, Bommes ended his handball career and, instead of pursuing a legal career after his first state law exam, chose to begin a journalism traineeship at NDR &ndash; a deliberate break from the obvious, secure path in favor of a new role in service of the public.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">From late 2007 to 2015, he anchored the <em>Hamburger Journal</em> and worked as a sports reporter, before joining the regular hosting team of ARD's <em>Sportschau am Sonntag</em> in 2011. The Beaver doesn't build for its own fame, but because it believes a reliable, well-crafted program serves a large audience &ndash; decades of steady care for the viewers who tune in week after week.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Six-Wing: Security Before the Big Leap</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Six-wing</strong> gives the social Seven a quality that contrasts with its versatility: caution, loyalty to institutions, a need for a reliable framework. Bommes didn't make the switch from handball to journalism abruptly, but only after completing his first state law exam &ndash; a secured step, not a leap into the unknown.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This wing shows even more clearly in his long-standing tie to the same broadcaster: from his traineeship at NDR through the Hamburger Journal to the ARD Sportschau and the quiz show <em>Gefragt – Gejagt</em>, which he has hosted since 2012, Bommes stayed loyal to the same institutional environment for nearly two decades, rather than jumping between broadcasters and formats. The Beaver would rather build within a proven, sturdy bank than prematurely leave secure ground.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Passion: Gluttony as Format Diversity</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The passion of the Seven is called <strong>gluttony</strong>, or excess: an insatiable appetite for ever new possibilities. In Bommes, this doesn't show as erraticism, but in the ability to carry several demanding formats simultaneously over years &ndash; live sports hosting, a daily news program, and a weekly quiz show, each with its own demands on pace, tone, and preparation.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In May 2025, Bommes announced he would end his role as live sports host at the ARD Sportschau to devote himself to new subjects &ndash; a change that is less a retreat than a continuation of the same excess: even after nearly two decades in a fixed format, the appetite for new tasks remains unbroken, as long as it stays within the same familiar institutional framework.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. The Work: From Bundesliga Handball Player to a Reliable Face of ARD</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">From Germany's top handball league through law school and his traineeship at NDR to nearly two decades as a fixed face of ARD, a single thread runs through Bommes' career: changes that were always made only after a solid foundation was in place, never on impulse.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The Beaver builds continuously, without pausing, but always on solid ground. Alexander Bommes' path from professional athlete through journalist to quiz-show host shows this drive at its most constructive: versatility that never detaches itself from the reliability of a familiar institutional framework.</p>

        <p class="krim-portrait-name">Aristotle</p>
        <p class="krim-portrait-typ">SE1w9 &middot; Self-Preservation Type 1 with Nine-Wing</p>
        <p class="krim-portrait-subtitle">Greek philosopher, 384–322 BC – Animal equivalent: Eagle</p>
      </div>
      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Eagle Over the Academy</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The Eagle flies alone, high enough to survey the whole field before it fixes on a single point. It seeks no validation in the crowd – it seeks overview, order, a clear view of the whole. No thinker of antiquity embodies this principle as completely as Aristotle.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The Greek philosopher Aristotle, born in 384 BC in Stagira, arrived at Plato's Academy in Athens at seventeen and stayed for nearly twenty years – first as a student, then as an independent thinker. He later became tutor to Alexander the Great and eventually founded his own school, the Lyceum. His work spans nearly every field of knowledge of his time: logic, physics, biology, ethics, politics, poetics, metaphysics – a life's work of a systematic rigor that still shapes Western science today.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Self-Preservation One: The Golden Mean as a Way of Life</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The self-preservation One (SE1) does not carry its standards outward to lecture others – it directs them first at itself, with a quiet, often invisible strictness. Naranjo called this subtype Worry: the constant, quiet question of whether one is really doing it right. In Aristotle, this shows up in one of the most influential ethical concepts in the history of philosophy: the Golden Mean (Mesotes), the principle that every virtue lies between two extremes – courage between cowardice and recklessness, generosity between stinginess and extravagance.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This is pure SE1 signature: not a moral crusade against the world, but the quiet, continuous self-correction of finding and holding the right balance in one's own conduct. Unlike his teacher Plato, who sought eternal, abstract ideas beyond the visible world, Aristotle anchored his ethics in lived practice: virtue arises not from insight alone, but through habituation – through the persistent, daily practice of the right thing until it becomes second nature.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Nine Wing: The Whole Field in View</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The Nine wing (w9) adds a rare breadth to the One's energy: the ability not just to perfectly order a single detail, but to survey and integrate an entire field at once. This is exactly what distinguishes Aristotle from a mere systematizer – he wanted not just to settle individual questions, but to bring the whole known world into one coherent order.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">His method was remarkably undogmatic for a One subtype: he dissected animals, observed natural phenomena, collected the political constitutions of Greek city-states – empirical observation instead of pure speculation. This calm, patient breadth of the Nine wing allowed him to write with the same equanimity about logic, biology, and poetics, without entrenching himself in a single battlefield of ideas – an eagle that surveys the entire territory before ordering it.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. Light and Shadow of the Self-Preservation One</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SE1w9 is the ability to create order without harshness – a system that does not force the world into rigid rules, but seeks the right mean for each situation. Aristotle's logic, his theory of categories, and his ethics remain cornerstones of Western thought even now, precisely because they aim at balance rather than dogma.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The shadow showed itself at the end of his life: after the death of Alexander the Great in 336 BC, a wave of anti-Macedonian sentiment turned against Aristotle as Alexander's former tutor. He fled Athens, saying he would not allow the city "to sin twice against philosophy" – a reference to the execution of Socrates. The self-preservation One rarely chooses open resistance in a crisis: it withdraws before the conflict escalates, even when that looks like quiet surrender.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. The Healing Path: From Strictness to Equanimity</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The healing path of the One leads from anger at one's own and others' imperfection to equanimity – the trust that the world can find its right course even without constant correction. Aristotle himself described this state in his ethics as Eudaimonia, the flourishing, self-contained life that grows out of the practice of virtue over time – not out of a single perfect moment.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">His final year in voluntary exile, far from Athens, shows the most mature side of the SE1w9: no bitterness, no last fight for vindication, but the calm withdrawal of an eagle that knows its work speaks for itself.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Legacy: An Order That Carries Millennia</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Hardly any thinker has ordered Western knowledge as fundamentally as Aristotle – his logic remained the foundation of scientific reasoning for over two thousand years, his ethics still shapes debates about the good life today, and his biology laid the groundwork for systematic natural observation.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The eagle that sought the golden mean and ordered the entire field of knowledge without forcing it into rigid extremes – that is the lasting image of the self-preservation One with a Nine wing: uncompromising precision, carried by the breadth to see everything in context.</p>

        <p class="krim-portrait-typ">SX7w8 &middot; Sexual Type 7 with aft wing</p>
        <p class="krim-portrait-subtitle">Professional tennis player, b. 1967 – Three-time Wimbledon champion, Olympic champion – Animal equivalent: Chimpanzee</p>
      </div>
      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Chimpanzee</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The chimpanzee is the animal of the sexual type 7 – and Boris Becker is a chimpanzee in his purest, most tempestuous form. The chimpanzee needs intensity: competition, contact, triumph. He lives in the now, takes full risks, and loves the game more than the plan. In 1985, at 17 years old, Boris Becker stepped onto Centre Court at Wimbledon as an unknown – and left it as the youngest Wimbledon champion of all time. The chimpanzee had struck. And the world was watching.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">What defines the chimpanzee is not his strength alone – it is his immediacy. Boris Becker was never a tactical player. He was an explosive one. His serve was thunder, his net attack was risk, his game was spectacle. That is the chimpanzee in full flourish: no calculation, no hesitation – only the moment that is everything.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The sexual Seven: Intensity as Identity</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The sexual Seven (SX7) seeks complete intoxication – the ultimate experience, the total fusion with what life has to offer. Naranjo called this subtype Suggestibility: the ability to sweep oneself and others into the whirlpool of an experience. The SX7 is contagious, magnetic, irresistible.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Boris Becker drew people into this quality for a decade. Not just as a player, but as a personality: louder than others, more open than others, more radiant than others. That is no stylistic device. That is the SX7 in its natural condition. It needs no stage to shine – it brings the stage along.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Eight wing: The Fighter in the Chimpanzee</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The Eight wing gives the sexual Seven something crucial: toughness. A Seven with a weaker Eight wing can dodge, negotiate, charm. A strongly developed Eight wing fights. He does not yield. He bites his way through. Boris Becker won matches he normally would have lost – because he refused to acknowledge that reality. That is the Eight wing of the sexual Seven: the refusal to lose the game before the last point is played.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This wing was his greatest gift on the court. It gave Becker something Sevens with a weaker Eight wing rarely possess: steadfastness under pressure. While other players tactically maneuvered or backed away in difficult moments, Becker escalated. He increased the risk when he actually should have played conservatively. He served aces when his opponents played it safe. That ability not to grow smaller in the decisive moment, but larger – that is the Eight wing in its rawest form.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Off the court, this wing became a trap. The Eight wing of the Seven believes that rules apply to others. That consequences are canceled if you are only determined enough. In tennis, that works: willpower can avert a match point. In life and in court, it does not. This conviction carried Becker through his entire career – and completely abandoned him in crisis.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Passion: Gluttony as a Way of Life</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The passion of the Seven is called gluttony or excess: the insatiable hunger for more. In the sexual Seven, this hunger is directed at experiences, intensity, the next peak. Becker did not save up. He lived – big, loud, lavishly. Houses, parties, affairs, investments, appearances. The Seven trusts that things will always continue because they have always continued.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">When this excess meets unlimited means, it is a feast. When the means end and the excess remains, a catastrophe emerges. For years, Becker lived as if the golden years had never ended. The Enneagram sees no character weakness in this – but the pattern of a Seven that has learned that intensity is the ultimate painkiller.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. The Gift: The Man Who Sweeps the Moment Along</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">What Boris Becker gave to German sports – and an entire generation – cannot be measured in titles alone. He carried people along. He turned a Saturday evening in Wimbledon into a national moment. That is the gift of the SX7w8: enthusiasm that spreads; joy that infects; a yes to life that wakes others up.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The chimpanzee with an Eight wing is, in his healthy expression, the person who says: this is possible, and I will prove it to you now, right here, in this moment. That is Boris Becker on July 7, 1985. The rest of his life is the question of whether he can learn who he is when that moment is over – and how he can exist without bringing it back.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Armadillo on Two Stages</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>armadillo</strong> is the animal of social Four &ndash; it does not hide its otherness, but carries it visibly before an audience, even when that otherness reshapes its identity entirely. Few biographies show this as vividly as that of Steven Demetre Georgiou, born in London in 1948: first as Cat Stevens, one of the most successful singer-songwriters of the early 1970s, then as Yusuf Islam, a public advocate for his new faith &ndash; two identities, two stages, one and the same underlying pattern.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In 1976, Stevens was caught in a dangerous current off the coast of Malibu and believed he was drowning. This near-death experience became the catalyst for a radical search for his own, true identity &ndash; beyond fame, beyond the surface the world saw.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. Social Four: The Search for the True Self Before an Audience</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro"><strong>Social Four (SO4)</strong> does not carry its otherness in hiding, but into the group &ndash; it seeks its own true identity, and makes this very search a public matter. After his near-death experience, Stevens explored various spiritual paths before &ndash; influenced by his brother David, who had converted to Islam, and a gifted copy of the Quran &ndash; formally embracing Islam in 1977 and taking the name Yusuf: the Arabic form of Joseph, whose story of temptation, betrayal and new beginning he describes as a mirror of his own path through the "temptations of fame."</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This renaming was no private, quiet act. Yusuf Islam has since repeatedly told his own story publicly &ndash; in interviews, lectures, speeches &ndash; as evidence that faith can offer answers and peace. That is social Four in its purest form: a deeply personal transformation is not hidden away, but becomes a message for others.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Three-Wing: From Pop Career to Mission</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Three-wing (w3)</strong> gives social Four purposefulness, structure and the ability to translate inner experience into visible, measurable results. Even as Cat Stevens, this showed: albums like "Tea for the Tillerman" (1970) and "Teaser and the Firecat" (1971) made him one of the best-selling artists of his time &ndash; introspective, personal lyrics wrapped in flawlessly produced, commercially successful songs.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">After his conversion, this same purposefulness carried over into a new mission: in 1983 he founded a Muslim primary school in London, later helped build the relief organization Muslim Aid, which became active across Africa, Asia and Europe. Rather than withdrawing, he built institutions &ndash; a school, an organization, a public presence. In 2006, he finally returned to music as well, under the name Yusuf/Cat Stevens. The Three-wing of SO4 does not seek quiet introspection, but the visible, structured realization of its own truth in the world.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. Two Identities, One Pattern</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">What distinguishes Stevens/Yusuf from many other celebrities who reoriented themselves religiously is the consistency with which he carried out the break: he left the music industry almost entirely for nearly three decades, sold his guitars, focused on family, faith and charitable work. No half-withdrawal, no side project &ndash; the new identity replaced the old one almost completely, before the two came back together in 2006.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This very radicalism is typical of social Four: once its own otherness is recognized, it is not integrated as one facet among others, but made the new center of identity &ndash; publicly, visibly, unmistakably.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Light and Shadow</h2>

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Eagle</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Eagle</strong> sees patterns where others see only isolated pieces. It circles high above the landscape, connecting what appears separate on the ground, and only strikes when it is absolutely certain. That is precisely Dan Brown's literary signature: symbols, codes, hidden connections between art, history, and religion &ndash; made visible by a gaze that surveys everything at once.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Before becoming a novelist, the American writer Dan Brown was a musician and songwriter without major success. The turning point came only with an early novel and, above all, with his breakthrough novel about symbolism and hidden codes, which made him world-famous in 2003. Here too: years of circling, then the precise dive at exactly the right moment.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Self-Preservation One: Research as Inner Duty</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>self-preservation One (SP1)</strong> directs its striving for perfection not outward at the world, but inward &ndash; onto its own preparation, its own craft, its own thoroughness. Naranjo called this subtype <em>Worry</em>. The SP1 constantly asks itself: Have I considered everything? Is every detail correct? Will this hold up to scrutiny?</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In Dan Brown, this shows in a near-legendary discipline of research. For his novels, he travels to locations himself, consults experts in art history, cryptography, and theology, and reworks manuscripts over years. His daily routine is reportedly tightly structured: an early start to writing, fixed breaks, an almost monastic work ritual. This is not perfectionism as an affectation &ndash; it is the inner voice of the One saying: <em>It has to be right before the world sees it.</em></p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Two-Wing: Accessibility as a Gift to the Reader</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Two-wing (w2)</strong> opens the strict, inwardly-directed One outward: it grants the capacity to give, to make accessible, to bring others along. A One with a weaker Two wing could keep its expertise to itself, remaining academic and unapproachable. A strongly developed Two-wing pushes it to share &ndash; understandably, excitingly, compellingly.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This is precisely the key to Brown's literary success: highly complex subjects from art history, symbolism, and theology are packaged into short, breathless chapters that pull in even readers unfamiliar with the field. The SP1w2 does not just want to be right &ndash; it wants others to be able to share in it. The eagle's precision, given away to a readership of millions.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. Light and Shadow of the Self-Preservation One</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SP1 is unmistakable: extraordinary thoroughness, reliable craftsmanship, a standard of quality that builds trust. Brown's books have sold in the tens of millions for over two decades &ndash; evidence that readers rely on that thoroughness.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The shadow is the other side of the same coin: the fate pattern of the One is <strong>anger</strong> &ndash; in the SP1, usually turned inward as persistent self-criticism. Brown has been sharply attacked by literary critics for years, both for his prose style and for historical inaccuracies in his novels. For a One whose entire self-understanding rests on correctness, that is exactly the most sensitive spot: the accusation of not having been thorough enough after all.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">That he keeps writing undeterred despite this criticism, keeps researching, keeps producing further books with the same meticulous care, shows an SP1 who has learned to trust his own standard &ndash; even when public opinion disagrees with him.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. The Path of Healing: From Worry to Quiet Certainty</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The healing path of the One leads from anger to stillness, from constant worry to quiet certainty: what was done with care may speak for itself. It no longer needs constant re-checking.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Dan Brown embodies this path in his sheer consistency. Decades of hard research work, recurring public criticism &ndash; and yet a body of work that keeps growing unbroken. The eagle is not thrown off course by headwinds. It knows its altitude. It knows what it is looking for &ndash; and when it has found it.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Crocodile</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Crocodile</strong> is the animal of Sexual Type 8 &ndash; and few images fit Donald Trump better. The crocodile is the oldest predator on earth: patient in waiting, lightning-fast in its strike, unimpressed by criticism and exceptionally hard to overcome. It draws others in &ndash; and those who come too close realise: that was not an invitation to friendship.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Trump has exactly this quality. He dominates rooms, attracts cameras, is never neutral &ndash; always provocative, always loud, always at the centre. For decades he was a media fixture before he became a politician. He did not break the rules of public presence &ndash; he rewrote them, just as the crocodile sets the rules in the water.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Sexual Eight: Possession</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Sexual Eight (SX8)</strong> is, according to Naranjo, the subtype he called <em>Possession</em>. The Sexual Eight does not want to be a mere winner &ndash; she wants everything: full attention, unconditional loyalty, total impact. The SX8 is passionate, intense and always in search of the next challenge large enough to truly fill her.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Trump's life reads like an SX8 biography: real-estate empire, casino operations, television show (<em>The Apprentice</em>), presidency, second presidency. No standstill, no withdrawal, no quiet greatness. Always the next deal, the next escalation, the next project larger than the last. The SX8 does not stop, because she cannot stop.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Seven-wing: The Joy of the Game</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Seven-wing</strong> gives the Sexual Eight a special energy: lightness, humour, risk-taking, and a certain playfulness that brightens the intense force of the Eight core. The SX8w7 is not only an attacker &ndash; she is also an entertainer. She knows how to hold an audience. She hurls one-liners, spins the truth so it plays like a show, and enjoys the spectacle of conflict.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Trump is not a politician in the classical sense &ndash; he is a character. His rallies are performances, his interviews are wrestling matches, his tweets are theatre. The Seven-wing gives him the energy to enjoy all of it. He is not uncomfortable with it. He loves it. That is what sets the SX8w7 apart from purely destructive force: it has fun.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Passion: Lust as Intensity</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The passion of the Eight is called <strong>Lust</strong> &ndash; but not in the narrow sense. It is a hunger for the whole, for intensity, for the unfiltered life. The Sexual Eight directs this hunger toward a person, a project, a vision. And she tolerates no half-measures.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In Trump this shows itself in his relationship to the Trump brand itself: he did not simply do business &ndash; he made <em>Trump</em> a brand, a promise of greatness, luxury and victory. The name on the skyscrapers, the gold colour, the superlative as standard: all expressions of a passion that cannot distinguish between itself and what it possesses. That is the SX8 in its clearest expression.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. The Gift: Courage for the Impossible</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">What the SX8w7 embodies at its best is genuine courage: the ability to compete against every expectation, to accept no defeat as final, and to play in a game that everyone else considers lost. Trump won the presidency twice &ndash; the second time after a defeat, two impeachment proceedings, and multiple criminal trials. That is no small thing.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The gift of the SX8w7 is this fearlessness: the refusal to give in, the energy that arises from the fight itself, and the willingness to show oneself &ndash; completely and undisguised, with all contradictions. The crocodile does not dive under. It stays at the surface. Visible, immovable, always ready.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Golden Retriever from the Provinces</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Golden Retriever</strong> is the animal of the social Two &ndash; devoted, irresistibly driven to be needed, ready to give everything for the pack it feels it belongs to. Few biographies show this as uncompromisingly as that of Eva Duarte, born in 1919 as the illegitimate daughter of a family of modest means in Los Toldos, a provincial Argentine town. At fifteen she moved to Buenos Aires to become an actress &ndash; not out of pure vanity, but out of a deep need to be seen and needed, in a city that barely noticed a penniless young woman at first.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In 1944 she met Colonel Juan Domingo Perón at a charity event for earthquake victims &ndash; a meeting that would prove symbolic of her entire subsequent life: caring for others as the very place where her own fate was decided. The Golden Retriever had found its pack &ndash; and with it a stage on which devotion and self-presentation no longer stood in contradiction.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Social Two: The Poor as Her Own People</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>social Two (SO2)</strong> directs the Two's caring not toward individual people but toward the community as a whole. Naranjo called this subtype <em>ambition</em> &ndash; the drive to become indispensable through impact in the larger field. As First Lady, Eva Perón built the <em>Fundación Eva Perón</em>, a vast welfare organization that built hospitals, schools, orphanages, and retirement homes and gave direct aid to millions of the poor &ndash; the <em>descamisados</em>, the "shirtless ones" &ndash; often in personal audiences where she received petitioners for hours on end.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This devotion was never quiet. Eva Perón gave fervent speeches in which she cast herself as a bridge between "the people" and her husband &ndash; "I will come back, and I will be millions," she said in substance in one of her last public speeches. The Golden Retriever does not bark down from the stage; it wades into the crowd &ndash; exactly what she did when she drove through the slums personally handing out gifts.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Three-Wing: From Actress to Myth</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Three-wing (w3)</strong> gives the social Two the drive toward visible impact, toward self-presentation, toward proof through public image. In Eva Perón this wing merges with her earlier career as a radio and film actress in a way that is almost impossible to separate: she brought the performer's stage presence directly into politics &ndash; artfully arranged appearances, fine gowns and jewelry as a deliberate message to a people she wanted to show that even a woman from the underclass could rise to the very top, carefully composed speeches, a self-written book (<em>La razón de mi vida</em>, roughly "The Reason for My Life") that shaped her own life into a political narrative.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The Three-wing didn't just want to help &ndash; it wanted the help to be visible, unforgettable, mythic. Out of pure SO2 caring grew "Evita": a brand, an icon, a political narrative figure larger than the person behind it. The same energy that made Julius Caesar (SO2w3) write his own war commentary in the third person drove Eva Perón to rewrite her own life as a stirring heroine's story.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. Light and Shadow of the Social Two</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SO2w3 is a form of care that genuinely reached millions: women's suffrage in Argentina, secured in 1947 substantially through her personal advocacy, concrete material help for people no government had ever bothered to notice before. That is no empty gesture &ndash; it is impact that changed real lives.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The Two's fateful pattern is <strong>pride</strong> &ndash; the deep conviction of being indispensable, combined with difficulty admitting one's own neediness. In Eva Perón this showed up as a growing intolerance of criticism: opposition newspapers were shut down, political opponents pressured, the line between personal care and political control increasingly blurred. Someone who sees herself as the people's indispensable savior finds it hard to recognize dissent as legitimate &ndash; it quickly becomes betrayal of the very people she gives everything for.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Death as the Final Performance</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Eva Perón fell ill with cervical cancer in the early 1950s, concealing the severity of her condition from the public &ndash; and partly from herself &ndash; for a long time, in order to remain present for her people. At her last public speech in June 1951 she had to lean on Perón for support; a supportive corset was already hidden beneath her coat against her advancing physical decline. She died on 26 July 1952, at only 33 years old.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Even her death became the greatest performance of her life: her body was embalmed so it could be venerated publicly in perpetuity &ndash; millions of people filed past her lying in state for days. The social Two with a Three-wing wanted her devotion to outlast her own mortality &ndash; and it did: the "Evita" myth is more alive today than the historical person Eva Duarte ever was.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Legacy: A Belonging That Outlasts</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">What Eva Perón left behind cannot be reduced to a political program. She changed how a woman from the humblest circumstances could claim public power, and left behind, in Peronism, a political movement that still shapes Argentina today &ndash; far beyond her early death.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">That is the gift of the SO2w3 in its most striking form: devotion that is never satisfied with quiet service, but becomes so visible that it outlasts generations. The Golden Retriever that doesn't just return to the pack, but becomes the legend the pack still remembers decades later.</p>

        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>eagle</strong> is not a frantic hunter. It circles calmly, patiently, across great distances – and this long, patient circling describes Fritz Wepper's six-decade acting career more accurately than any spectacular breakthrough. Wepper was born in 1941 in Munich; his father Friedrich was reported missing during the Russian campaign in 1944 and never returned from the war. At just nine, Wepper was already on air for Bavarian Radio, and appearances in numerous children's films made him a child star in the 1950s – a public career that began before he could even process the loss of his father.</p>

Wepper delivered this reliability across half a century: for 24 years, from 1974 to 1998, he played the assistant Harry Klein at the side of <a href="#beruehmte-horst-tappert">Horst Tappert (SP3w2)</a> in "Derrick," followed by nearly two more decades, from 2002 to 2021, as Mayor Wöller in "Um Himmels Willen" – 260 episodes, one of the longest-running German television series of all time.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Two roles, nearly 45 years back to back, without any major break: this continuity is no accident but the quiet logic of the SP1 – once trust has been built, it is defended through steady, repeated reliability, not through constant reinvention.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Nine-wing: The Supporting Role as a Life Principle</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Nine-wing (w9)</strong> gives the Self-Preservation One calm and equanimity rather than drivenness. The SP1w9 does not need to convince anyone of anything and rarely seeks the spotlight. What stands out in Wepper's career is that in both of his most defining roles he deliberately played second fiddle: Harry Klein was the assistant, not the investigating chief inspector; Mayor Wöller was a supporting figure alongside the nuns at the center of the series. No drive to claim the lead role, but a quiet willingness to fill a load-bearing yet never front-and-center function for decades.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Away from the screen, too, Wepper rarely made headlines through controversy or scandal – a public reticence that matched his steady, unassuming on-screen presence. The Nine-wing carries peace inward, rather than seeking attention outward.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. Light and Shadow of the Self-Preservation One</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SP1w9 is obvious: extraordinary reliability across decades, carrying two of Germany's longest-running television series without the quality ever slipping. Across generations, millions of viewers associated Wepper with the same feeling of familiarity and dependability.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The shadow lies more deeply hidden than in more reactive subtypes. The One's fatal flaw is <strong>anger</strong> – in the SP1w9 muffled, almost numbed, by the Nine-wing. The early loss of his father in the war, which he rarely spoke of publicly, and the death of his younger brother, actor Elmar Wepper, only a few months before his own death in 2024, point to a quiet grief rarely processed openly – typical of a subtype that lets its own needs disappear behind the next task rather than naming them directly.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. The Healing Path: From Quiet Duty to Genuine Rest</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The One's healing path leads from anger to serenity – for the SP1w9, from forced, work-driven rest to genuine, freely chosen rest. Wepper embodied this path in his own, unspectacular way: a lifetime of the same reliable presence, without the drive to reinvent himself or push into the foreground.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The eagle that began to fly as a child and spent its whole life in calm, wide circles, never throwing itself into a spectacular dive – that is the lasting image of this subtype: a steadiness that needs no applause to be worthwhile.</p>

        <p class="krim-portrait-subtitle">Veterinarian, Wildlife Conservationist &amp; TV Host, b. 1992 – Terra X: Faszination Erde – Animal correspondence: Golden Retriever</p>
      </div>
      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Golden Retriever</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Golden Retriever</strong> is the animal of the social Two, a creature that does not treat connection as a task but as its very nature. Friendly, engaged, with a warmth that leaves no one out. The Golden Retriever does not push itself forward, but it is there the moment it's needed – and when things get serious, remarkable stamina and readiness show up behind the warmth.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The German veterinarian and TV host Hannah Emde, born in 1992 in Bonn, embodies exactly this image: after finishing school, she spent twelve months in the Philippines through the volunteer program weltwärts, then studied veterinary medicine at the University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, graduating as a licensed veterinarian in 2019. Anyone following her path sees not a straightforward TV career, but a biography that placed itself, step by step, in service of something larger.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Social Two: Care That Wants to Reach the Many</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>social Two (SO2)</strong> directs the Two's energy not toward individual, personal bonds, but toward the larger field: community, the public, societal impact. Naranjo called this subtype <em>Ambition</em> – not ambition for its own sake, but the drive to make a difference for as many people as possible. The SO2 doesn't only ask, <em>How can I help this one person?</em> but rather, <em>How can I become indispensable to the bigger picture?</em></p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In Hannah Emde, this shows up as a remarkable doubling of her commitment: in 2017, at just 25, she founded the nonprofit organization <em>Nepada Wildlife e.V.</em>, which promotes species conservation through environmental education, veterinary work, research, and public outreach – before her studies were even finished. From 2021 to 2023, she additionally worked as a veterinarian and consultant for the German Society for International Cooperation (GIZ) on a One Health initiative, helping build the international alliance against health risks in the wildlife trade.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Since April 2024, she has hosted the ZDF series <em>Terra X: Faszination Erde</em>, reaching a mass audience – the logical continuation of the same movement: what began as personal commitment within a single nonprofit becomes a stage on which species conservation is brought to a broad public. Already in 2022, her six-part documentary series aired in the ARD Mediathek, in which she met people in Namibia working for wildlife conservation – here too, she herself was never the focus, but the stories of those making a difference on the ground.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The One-Wing: Professional Rigor Instead of Mere Likability</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>One-wing</strong> gives the social Two an inner axis that isn't automatically there with a weaker One-wing: the standard of getting it professionally right, not just coming across as likable. Where an SO2 with a weaker One-wing might rely more on charisma and popularity, the One demands a solid professional foundation before ever stepping onto a stage at all.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In Hannah Emde, this wing is unmistakable: she hosts nature documentaries not as a lateral entrant, but as a licensed veterinarian with a completed degree from one of Germany's most respected veterinary schools. Her work on an international One Health initiative combating health risks in the wildlife trade is not a PR gesture, but genuine policy work. This is the SO2w1: the Two's warmheartedness, combined with the One's inner standard that commitment to animals and nature must be based on real knowledge, not just good intentions.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Founding Nepada Wildlife e.V. while still a student also shows this combination: not waiting until training is fully complete, but also not acting without structure – instead, building a nonprofit with a clear mission from the start, encompassing education, research, and veterinary practice. The One ensures that good intentions turn into structures that hold.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. Light and Shadow of the Social Two</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SO2w1 is its ability to translate care into reach: not just helping a single animal, but achieving an impact through education, research, and media presence that extends far beyond one's own practice. Hannah Emde's path from founding a small nonprofit to becoming a nationally known TV host shows how personal commitment can become a platform without losing its professional substance.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The fateful pattern of the Two is <strong>pride</strong> – the deep need to be needed and indispensable. In the SO2w1, this shows up as a high, often self-imposed standard: the feeling of having to constantly live up to the trust placed in her as the face of wildlife conservation on German television. Such a combination of public visibility and professional perfectionism can carry someone far – but it can also exhaust, if one's own worth stays too tightly bound to constantly proving oneself.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. From the Examination Table to the Screen</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The shift from practicing veterinarian and nonprofit founder to well-known TV host does not, for Hannah Emde, mean leaving her actual profession behind, but expanding it: instead of working solely with individual animals, she uses television's reach to make species conservation understandable to a mass audience. The SO2w1 meets this larger stage not by distancing herself from her professional roots, but by bringing exactly those roots onto the screen with her.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Her social orientation remains palpable throughout: her formats rarely center on herself, but repeatedly on the animals, the ecosystems, and the people on the ground – just as in her ARD documentary series on Namibia's wildlife conservationists. The Golden Retriever carries the attention it receives further, toward those who actually deserve it.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Gift: Expertise That Creates Closeness</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">What Hannah Emde brings to her work is a rare combination: the warmth that draws a mass audience into nature topics, and the professional depth of a licensed veterinarian who knows what she's talking about. This is the gift of the SO2w1 – a Golden Retriever who doesn't just inspire sympathy, but who knows that real trust only forms when care and expertise come together.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In a media landscape that often reduces nature topics to pretty pictures, Hannah Emde stands out for the opposite: her willingness not to hide her actual professional work – nonprofit leadership, international health policy, veterinary practice – behind her television presence, but to make it the foundation of it. The Golden Retriever doesn't run ahead to be admired. It runs because the cause it serves needs it – and that is exactly what makes it credible.</p>

        <p class="krim-portrait-typ">SO4w3 &middot; Social Type 4 with Three-wing</p>
        <p class="krim-portrait-subtitle">British actor, born 1960 &ndash; Animal correspondence: Armadillo</p>
      </div>
      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Armadillo with the Stammering Charm</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>armadillo</strong> is the animal of the social Four &ndash; a creature that does not hide its difference but wears it visibly on its skin. Unlike its more introverted counterparts, this Four does not retreat into its own shell but turns it into a signature trademark &ndash; as proof of its own uniqueness, on a stage everyone can see.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The British actor Hugh Grant was born in 1960 in London, studied English Literature at Oxford, and was already performing on stage there before tentatively turning to film. His international breakthrough came only in 1994, in his mid-thirties, in "Four Weddings and a Funeral" &ndash; a role that defined one very specific character: the charmingly stammering, perpetually apologizing Englishman who can barely finish a sentence for sheer self-doubt. That one, unmistakable nuance became his trademark &ndash; and the blueprint for his entire early career.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Social Four: Turning Awkwardness into a Unique Selling Point</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>social Four (SO4)</strong> does not live its difference in hiding but seeks out the group, precisely in order to be seen there as the special exception. Grant built his entire early career on one single, highly specific form of otherness: his own publicly displayed social awkwardness. In "Notting Hill," "Bridget Jones's Diary," and "Love Actually," he played variations of the same figure &ndash; lovable, but structurally insecure, unable to say his own feelings straight out.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Grant himself repeatedly confirmed this self-perception in public: he described himself as "terribly insecure" and said he had feared his entire career that any given film could be his last. This is typical of the social Four: one's own vulnerability is not hidden but transformed into a recognizable image that fascinates an audience of millions &ndash; and that simultaneously proves just how different one is from the mass of self-assured leading men.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Three-Wing: The Calculated Reinvention</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Three-wing (w3)</strong> gives the Four the ability not only to feel its own image but to market it deliberately and reinvent it when needed. When Grant himself concluded he had gotten "too old and ugly and fat" to keep playing the romantic lead, he pulled off one of Hollywood's most remarkable image transformations: he became a character actor for dazzling villains and complex supporting roles &ndash; the vain children's author in "Paddington 2," the shifty lawyer in "The Gentlemen," politician Jeremy Thorpe in "A Very English Scandal," for which he received an Emmy nomination.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This deliberate, strategic repositioning &ndash; away from the lovable stammerer, toward the darker character actor &ndash; is the purest expression of SO4w3: the Four feels the fading relevance of the old image, the Three-wing stages a new, successful performance from it instead of clinging to the old role.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Price of the Public Stage</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">In 1995, at the height of his fame, Grant was arrested in Los Angeles after being found in a parked car with a sex worker &ndash; a personal low point that filled every tabloid in the world. Instead of withdrawing, Grant went on "The Tonight Show" with Jay Leno just days later and faced the public humiliation head-on, with exactly the self-deprecating, sheepish openness that had already defined his screen persona. The appearance is still considered one of the most skillful crisis interviews in celebrity history &ndash; and it saved his career instead of ending it.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">For the social Four with Three-wing, the deepest personal misstep of all became a public stage: shame was not hidden but transformed, in real time, into a performance that won the audience over &ndash; a pattern that repeated decades later in Grant's much-discussed, deliberately uncomfortable interview appearances, such as at the 2023 Oscars, widely described online as "deliciously awkward."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Light and Shadow</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of SO4w3 is the ability to <strong>turn deep insecurity into effective art</strong> &ndash; to shape a single, honestly felt weakness into a character that an audience of millions loves for decades. Grant's best roles live from exactly this risk: not avoiding his own embarrassment, but turning it into a comic and moving art form.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The shadow shows itself in a chronic, publicly admitted self-deprecation: Grant repeatedly called himself the "dumb" one in his family and spoke of having "marginally less self-hatred" since he stopped being typecast as the romantic lead. The flip side of SO4w3: when one's own insecurity becomes the most reliable currency, genuine self-acceptance can vanish behind perfectly calculated self-irony &ndash; and some interviewers get, instead of the charm, only the prickly, dismissive side of that same façade.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Armadillo That Made Its Insecurity a Signature</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Hugh Grant remains one of the few actors to have turned two entirely different career phases into independent successes &ndash; first as the stammering romantic lead of an entire genre, then as one of his generation's most interesting character actors. Both phases draw from the same source: the willingness not to hide his own awkwardness and insecurity, but to make it visible.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The armadillo that never concealed its most vulnerable side, but first turned it into the trademark of the lovable stammerer and later into the foundation of darker character roles &ndash; that is the lasting image of the social Four with Three-wing: vulnerability that reinvents itself instead of disappearing.</p>

        <p class="krim-portrait-subtitle">Actress & activist, b. 1958 – Animal equivalent: Black Mamba</p>
      </div>
      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Black Mamba</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The Black Mamba is the animal of the sexual One, and no animal fits Jamie Lee Curtis more accurately. The Black Mamba is one of the most venomous snakes in the world, lightning-fast, precise, and completely uncompromising. It does not attack out of aggression—it acts out of an inner law. What is wrong is named. What is fake is rejected. What is right is defended with full commitment.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Jamie Lee Curtis, born in 1958 as the daughter of Hollywood legends Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh, grew up in a world where beauty, fame, and appearance were the measure of all things—and developed an inner resistance to exactly that early on. Her career began in 1978 with John Carpenter's Halloween: a horror film, a scream queen, and a young woman who from the very start wanted more than what the genre offered her.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Sexual One: Passion as Inner Fire</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The sexual One (SX1) is the subtype of the One that directs its demand for perfection not at itself or at the collective, but at intensity—at complete presence, complete authenticity, complete honesty in everything that matters. Naranjo called this subtype Zeal: fervency, eagerness, a burning desire for the genuine.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Jamie Lee Curtis lives this subtype with an openness that is rare in Hollywood. She was one of the first actresses to speak publicly about her addiction: for 22 years she was addicted to opiates; she has been sober since 1999. She spoke about failed marriages, about the challenges of motherhood, about the absurdity of beauty standards. Not as a confession, but as an avowal: what is real is worth more than appearance.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In 2021, she was photographed for AARP magazine without retouching, without makeup, without staging. For an actress in an industry where aging is considered a flaw, that was an act. For an SX1, it went without saying.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Two Wing: Care as a Second Force</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The Two wing (w2) gives the sexual One something decisive: genuine warmth and empathy. The SX1w2 is not only uncompromising in her own cause—she cares, she nurtures, she stands by others. The intensity of the sexual One is directed outward through the Two wing: not as control, but as connection.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">When her daughter Ruby came out as transgender, Jamie Lee Curtis immediately stepped to her side publicly—unconditionally, loudly, clearly. As a long-standing patron of children's hospitals, she has been committed to sick children for decades. Her friendships—especially the legendary one with John Cleese and the rest of the A Fish Called Wanda cast—are known for their depth and endurance. The Black Mamba bites for others just as she does for herself.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Passion: Wrath as a Purifying Fire</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The passion of the One is called wrath, and in the SX1w2 it burns particularly bright because it is connected with the intensity of the sexual subtype. Jamie Lee Curtis has no fear of showing this wrath: against a film industry that makes women over forty invisible; against beauty industries that sell insecurity; against a society that judges addicts instead of supporting them.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This wrath is not destructive. It is purifying. It clears things up. The SX1 tolerates no hypocrisy, nor does she keep silent about it. What distinguishes Jamie Lee Curtis from many others: she shows the wrath and the warmth at the same time. Not alternately, but together. The mamba and the Two wing are no contradiction.</p>

          <p class="vb-intro">In 2023, Jamie Lee Curtis won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for Everything Everywhere All at Once at the age of 64, after a career spanning nearly fifty years. It was her first Oscar. Her acceptance speech was as expected from an SX1w2: direct, emotional, completely present. She cried. She laughed. She spoke about her parents, her sobriety, her family.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This moment is the symbol of her life's journey: not early and flashy, but matured, genuine, and complete. The Black Mamba needs no stage to prove herself—but when the stage comes, she is ready. And when she speaks, she means it.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Gift: Authenticity as an Invitation</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">What Jamie Lee Curtis has given to the world can be summed up in one sentence: she proved that you don't have to bend yourself to endure. Not in Hollywood, not in public, not in old age. That is the gift of the SX1w2: the fire that does not extinguish when it shows itself, but burns brightest precisely then.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The Black Mamba does not dodge. She is completely there, completely herself—and the Two wing ensures that this completeness gives courage to others. Not as a role model in the classic sense, but as living proof: what is genuine lasts longer than appearance.</p>

        <p class="krim-portrait-subtitle">German composer and organist, 1685&ndash;1750 &ndash; Animal correspondence: Black Mamba</p>
      </div>
      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Black Mamba</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>black mamba</strong> appears unremarkable from the outside, almost withdrawn &ndash; until it perceives its integrity to be threatened. Then it responds with a precision and uncompromising force that leaves no doubt. Johann Sebastian Bach carried exactly this double face: outwardly the quiet, dutiful church musician for a lifetime &ndash; and a man who did not hesitate for a second when his musical convictions were called into question.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Orphaned early &ndash; both parents died before his tenth birthday &ndash; the German composer Johann Sebastian Bach grew up with his older brother Johann Christoph, who denied him access to a valuable collection of sheet music. The young Bach copied it in secret, for months, by moonlight &ndash; an early testament to the zeal with which he claimed what he believed rightfully his, whatever the cost, even to his own eyesight.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. Sexual One: Zeal and the Contratype</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro"><strong>Sexual One (SX1)</strong> is the <strong>contratype of the One</strong> &ndash; the subtype that looks least like a moralizer and yet is the most uncompromising of all. Naranjo called this subtype <em>Zeal</em>: a burning desire to come as close as possible to the perfect, more unfiltered and direct than in any other One subtype. Bach lived this zeal not in words but in an almost inexhaustible creative intensity &ndash; over 1,000 surviving works, often a complete cantata per week for years on end.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">At age 20, he walked from Arnstadt roughly 400 kilometers to Lübeck to hear the famous organist Dieterich Buxtehude play &ndash; and stayed, instead of the approved four weeks, a full four months, willingly risking his position in Arnstadt and its consequences. That is Sexual One: when something is worthy of full commitment, there is no halfhearted measure.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Nine-Wing: Persistence Behind the Fire</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Nine-wing (w9)</strong> gives the intensity of Sexual One a peculiar stamina &ndash; a quiet, almost unremarkable persistence that is not discouraged by resistance. In 1717, in Weimar, Bach demanded his dismissal from the service of Duke Wilhelm Ernst so persistently, wanting to take up a better position in Köthen, that the Duke simply had him imprisoned for a month. Bach did not relent &ndash; and upon his release, dishonorably discharged, took up the new position anyway.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This persistence also carried him through 27 years as Thomaskantor in Leipzig, a post he never abandoned despite constant friction with the town council, filling it instead from within, week after week, with new music. The Nine-wing does not hold the One back &ndash; it anchors its fire in one place until the task has been fully mastered.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Passion: Anger as Moral Judgment</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The passion of the One is called <strong>anger</strong> &ndash; and in SX1w9 it discharges wherever one's own high standards are violated. In 1705, still in Arnstadt, Bach called a bassoonist named Geyersbach a "nanny-goat bassoonist" for criticizing his organ accompaniment &ndash; the dispute escalated into a street brawl, for which Bach had to answer before the church consistory. His choir direction was also reprimanded: he ornamented the chorales with such elaborate, "strange variations" that the congregation could no longer sing along &ndash; early evidence that Bach rarely subordinated artistic perfection to consensus.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In Leipzig this pattern continued: his complaint document "Entwurff einer wohlbestallten Kirchenmusic" (1730) lists, without mercy, the shortcomings he believed were undermining his music &ndash; too few, too poorly trained musicians, insufficient support from the council. Not private resentment, but a factual, uncompromising judgment on what was owed to the cause &ndash; music to the glory of God.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Soli Deo Gloria: Zeal as Spiritual Discipline</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Over many of his manuscripts, Bach wrote the abbreviation "J.J." (Jesu Juva &ndash; Jesus, help) at the beginning and "S.D.G." (Soli Deo Gloria &ndash; to God alone the glory) at the end. This was no pious formula but the core of his Sexual One: music was not for him an expression of personal genius, but a spiritual duty to be fulfilled with the utmost precision. Perfection, for Bach, was not ambition &ndash; it was worship.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This same seriousness extended to his family: with two wives, he had 20 children, several of whom he personally and rigorously trained in composition &ndash; Carl Philipp Emanuel, Wilhelm Friedemann, and Johann Christian Bach all became significant composers in their own right. The Nine-wing shows itself here in the quiet, domestic constancy of a family life that stood in diametrical contrast to the loud public struggles over his official posts.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Legacy: The Unyielding Man Barely Recognized in His Lifetime</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">In his lifetime, Bach was regarded above all as an outstanding organist, far less as the composer posterity now knows. Only in 1829, nearly 80 years after his death, did the young Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy bring the St Matthew Passion back to performance, sparking the Bach revival that continues to this day. The quiet church musician from Leipzig became, posthumously, the standard against which generations of composers measured themselves &ndash; among them Beethoven (SX6w5) and Brahms (SP9w8).</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The legacy of SX1w9 lies exactly in this tension: a zeal that needed no recognition to give itself fully, and a persistence that knew all along that the real test was not the applause of contemporaries, but the music itself. The black mamba that no one needed to fear &ndash; unless they betrayed its standards.</p>

        <p class="krim-portrait-typ">SO2w3 &middot; Social Type 2 with Three-wing</p>
        <p class="krim-portrait-subtitle">Politician, former US Vice President, b. 1964 – Animal correspondence: Golden Retriever</p>
      </div>
      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Golden Retriever</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Golden Retriever</strong> is the animal of the social Two, a creature that seeks belonging by committing itself to the community. Friendly, engaged, oriented toward connection. The Golden Retriever wants to be needed, not by one person, but by many. It runs ahead, looks back, gathers the group. And when things get tough, it becomes clear that behind the warmth lies a tenacious will.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The American politician Kamala Harris, born in 1964 in Oakland as the daughter of an Indian cancer researcher and a Jamaican economist, grew up in a household shaped by civil rights activism, her mother took her to demonstrations as a toddler. That early imprint became a career that circled almost without interruption around a single question: how can I become effective for the community?</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Social Two: Service as Political Calling</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>social Two (SO2)</strong> directs the energy of the Two not toward individual personal bonds, but toward the larger field: community, the public, social impact. Naranjo called this subtype <em>Ambition</em>, not ambition for its own sake, but the drive to accomplish more for many through influence and visibility. The SO2 asks: <em>How can I become indispensable to this community?</em></p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Kamala Harris's entire career follows this logic: prosecutor, Attorney General of California, US Senator, Vice President. She repeatedly chose offices in which she could act directly on behalf of others, as a prosecutor for victims, as a senator for voters, as vice president for an entire country. Her campaign slogan <em>For the People</em>, carried over from her time as a prosecutor, captures the SO2 stance exactly: acting in the name of the community, not the self.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Her public manner too, the laughter, the embraces, the need to connect personally with as many people as possible, is typical SO2 energy. The Golden Retriever does not bark down from the stage. It goes into the crowd, shakes hands, listens.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Three-wing: Effectiveness as Proof</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Three-wing (w3)</strong> gives the social Two something decisive: the drive toward visible achievement, measurable success, proof that one's own work is effective. An SO2 with a weaker Three-wing could lose itself in service to others. The Three-wing sets goals, demands results, wants to arrive rather than merely be on the way.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In Kamala Harris this shows in a series of historic firsts: first woman, first Black person, and first person of South Asian descent as Attorney General of California, as a US Senator from California in that combination, as Vice President of the United States. The Three-wing does not settle for second place, it asks: how much further can this go? Who else can benefit from it?</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This wing also has its price. Critics accused Harris during her time as a prosecutor of relying too heavily on tough statistics, conviction rates, harshness on parole violations, issues she later reflected on critically herself. The Three-wing of the SO2 can mistake success for effectiveness, even in places where care would have called for more leniency.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. Light and Shadow of the Social Two</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SO2w3 is its ability to combine genuine engagement with strategic effectiveness. As a prosecutor, Kamala Harris built programs for the rehabilitation of young first-time offenders, championed consumer protection, and fought mortgage fraud, issues that rarely make headlines but help people directly. That is the SO2 at its most constructive: impact that does not wait for applause.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The fate pattern of the Two is <strong>pride</strong>, the deep need to be needed and indispensable. In the SO2w3 this shows as the pressure to fill every role perfectly, to meet every expectation, as vice president, as presidential candidate, as a symbolic figure for several social groups at once. This layered burden of representation is a real weight many SO2w3 personalities in public office carry, and one rarely spoken about openly.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Critics have accused Harris of adjusting her positions to the political climate. From the SO2 perspective this can also be read differently: the constant effort not to lose connection with as many different groups as possible, a strength that becomes a weakness when it costs clarity about what one stands for oneself.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. The 2024 Campaign: Service Under Time Pressure</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">When President Biden announced his withdrawal from the race in the summer of 2024, Kamala Harris took over leadership of the Democratic campaign within days, without warning, without preparation time, under enormous public pressure. For an SO2w3, that is the ultimate test: the community calls, and she answers, no matter how short the notice.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Her campaign was marked by a striking emphasis on community and unity, <em>We are not going back</em>, and by tireless personal effort, rally after rally. The Golden Retriever with the Three-wing keeps running even when its strength should long have run out, because the people counting on it need it.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Gift: Effective Service</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">What Kamala Harris has brought to American politics cannot be reduced to election results: the opening of the highest offices to people not previously represented there, and a vision of political service that never wanted to give up personal closeness to people, even on the largest possible stage.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">That is the gift of the SO2w3: engagement that does not settle for quiet effort but wants to become visible so it can reach more people. The Golden Retriever that does not just wag its tail but runs, because it knows someone is waiting on the other end.</p>

        <p class="krim-portrait-typ">SX9w1 &middot; Sexual Type 9 with One-wing</p>
        <p class="krim-portrait-subtitle">Actor, b. 1973 &ndash; Animal correspondence: Sloth</p>
      </div>
      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Sloth</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>sloth</strong> is the animal of sexual Nine &ndash; an animal that, wherever it is placed, connects fully with that one branch instead of constantly searching for a better one. It doesn't adapt to its surroundings to stand out &ndash; it merges with them, until there is barely any difference between it and the tree.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">British actor Kris Marshall, born April 1, 1973, in Bath, Somerset, had to summon this capacity for total connection again and again, even as a child. His father Glyn Marshall was a navigator with the Royal Air Force, rose to Squadron Leader, and served with the Queen's Flight &ndash; a career that moved the family through changing postings, including Hong Kong and Canada. Until he was ten, Kris spoke with a Canadian accent. When he was twelve, his parents divorced; he then attended Wells Cathedral School as a boarder &ndash; another new place, another new, this time very strictly ordered environment he had to fit into.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. Sexual Nine: Few Bonds, Held Very Long</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro"><strong>Sexual Nine (SX9)</strong> is, according to Naranjo, the subtype of <em>union</em>: the longing not to participate superficially, but to be fully absorbed in a single bond, a single work. For a child who repeatedly had to get to know new countries, new schools, new caregivers, such a longing for the one reliable anchor point is not an abstract type theory, but a very understandable reaction to an unsettled childhood.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This exact pattern runs through Kris Marshall's entire career: from 2000 to 2011 he played the same character, Nick Harper, in the BBC sitcom <em>My Family</em> for eleven years. At the same time, for over a decade he was the face of the same British advertising campaign, as the trainee "Kevin" for BT/EE. <em>Death in Paradise</em>, too, in which he played detective DI Humphrey Goodman from 2014 to 2017, he stuck with for four seasons before &ndash; by his own, publicly stated account &ndash; leaving the series for family reasons. Where other actors deliberately move between many roles to show their range, Marshall chooses few bonds &ndash; and holds them unusually long.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The One-Wing: Quiet Order After Things Fall Apart</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">An SX9 with a weaker One-wing would likely have lived through childhood's many ruptures &ndash; changing countries, parents' divorce, boarding school &ndash; with pure willingness to adapt: simply drifting along, without inner anchoring. In Marshall, something else emerged early instead, something that still runs through his public presence today: a quiet, unshowy discipline, a need for a clear order of his own, precisely because external circumstances changed so often. The strictly regulated boarding-school life after the divorce did not fall on barren ground with him, but on a personality that needed exactly this structure to hold itself together.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The same trait shows in his public presence: Kris Marshall is considered noticeably reserved within British show business &ndash; barely any home stories, barely any gossip-column presence, barely the usual interview carousel around major roles. This is not avoidance out of fear, but a self-set standard: revealing no more of himself than necessary. And when a limit is reached &ndash; as at the point where filming in the Caribbean collided with his own family &ndash; it is not negotiated at length but drawn clearly, and the consequence carried out calmly. That is the One-wing: no loud principle, but a quiet, unshakeable inner line.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Role as Echo: Humphrey Goodman</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">As is often the case with actors who play a role that suits them particularly well, a resonance with his own underlying stance can be recognized in Kris Marshall's best-known character, DI Humphrey Goodman in <em>Death in Paradise</em> &ndash; not as identity, but as echo. Goodman appears outwardly chaotic, stumbling through the Caribbean heat in a full suit, constantly losing objects. Yet in substance he remains incorruptibly precise: he solves every case to the end, refuses to settle for a convenient, half-finished solution, and insists on justice for suspects and victims alike.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This combination &ndash; outward disorder alongside unshakeable inner thoroughness &ndash; is the role as evidence, not as a substitute for the person: it shows the same pattern that appears more clearly in Marshall's actual career than in any single character &ndash; the ability to behave unobtrusively on the outside while a very precise, very consistent standard governs within.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Light and Shadow</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of SX9w1 is its <strong>ability to build a reliable inner order out of repeated external instability</strong> &ndash; and to sustain that order over decades without it hardening into rigidity. Marshall's eleven years on <em>My Family</em>, his decade as "Kevin," his four seasons as Humphrey Goodman all show the same constant: reliability that rests not on compulsion, but on a self-chosen inner standard.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The shadow shows in the flip side of this early-learned self-discipline: someone who learned as a child to protect themselves through inner order in every new environment may find it hard to relinquish control or engage with real chaos. The reserve that reads as strength in show business can, in private, also mean that closeness is only permitted once it doesn't threaten one's own order.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Sloth That Chooses Family</h2>

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Hippopotamus</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Hippopotamus</strong> is the animal of the self-preservation Two &ndash; an animal that unfolds its full strength wherever it feels safe and rooted. Lisa Antoni, born and raised in Vienna, found that secure ground in Viennese musical theatre – her first major role as Mary Vetsera in the German-language premiere of <em>Rudolf – Affaire Mayerling</em> became the starting point of a career that stayed closely tied to her home city.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The cast recording of that production reached platinum status in Austria – an early, concrete sign that Antoni's voice and presence reached a broad audience, long before she became one of the most sought-after musical theatre performers in the German-speaking world.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Self-Preservation Two: Care Through Reliable Craft</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Naranjo called the <strong>self-preservation Two (SE2)</strong> <em>Me First</em>: she secures closeness and belonging through concrete, reliable performance within a familiar environment, not through grand public gestures. Antoni's career reads like a demonstration of this stance – roles in <em>Into the Woods</em>, <em>Rebecca</em>, <em>The Witches of Eastwick</em>, <em>Next to Normal</em>, <em>Showboat</em>, <em>Artus – Excalibur</em>, <em>The Addams Family</em>, and <em>How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying</em> across Austria, Germany, and Switzerland.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Rather than focus on a single major role, she built a broad, reliable repertoire within the German-speaking musical theatre scene over years – care for her own craft, expressed through steady, high-quality work rather than spectacular one-off appearances.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Three-Wing: The Grand Stage as a Visible Peak</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Three-wing (w3)</strong> gives the self-preservation Two the drive to still seek the biggest, most publicly effective roles from a solid, broad base. For Antoni, that meant the role of Christine Daaé in <em>The Phantom of the Opera</em> at the Ronacher Theatre in Vienna – one of the best-known female leads in the international musical theatre repertoire, on one of her home city's biggest stages.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This role brings both together: the reliable, craft-based foundation of a broad repertoire and the visible, publicly recognized success of one of the most coveted female musical theatre roles of all.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. Light and Shadow of the Self-Preservation Two</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SE2w3 lies in the ability to reach the great, visible roles through steady, reliable work in a familiar environment – Antoni's path from her first major role in Vienna to Christine Daaé shows a career built step by step out of solid craft.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The fate pattern of the Two is <strong>pride</strong> &ndash; the conviction of being indispensable to a production's success through one's own reliable performance. In the SE2w3, this can combine with the wish to prove herself in as many different, publicly visible roles as possible – a strength that leads to a broad repertoire, but also raises the question of how much room remains for the one truly defining signature role.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. The Work: From Mary Vetsera to Christine Daaé</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">From Mary Vetsera in <em>Rudolf – Affaire Mayerling</em> through a broad repertoire in German-speaking musical theatre to Christine Daaé at the Ronacher, a single thread runs through Antoni's work: reliable, craft-based work that worked its way step by step to the genre's greatest roles.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The hippopotamus does not leave its ancestral waters to please others – it deepens its connection to them with every new role. Lisa Antoni's path from the Viennese musical theatre stage to one of the most famous female roles in the international repertoire illustrates this principle perfectly: success that grows out of steady reliability, not out of a single great leap.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Black Mamba</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The Black Mamba is the animal of the sexual One—lightning-fast, precise, and completely uncompromising. It does not attack out of aggression, but out of an inner law: what is wrong is called out. What is disingenuous is rejected. What is right is defended with everything available.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The German politician Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, born in 1958 in Düsseldorf, is one of the most direct politicians the German Bundestag has experienced in recent decades. As chair of the Defense Committee, she became the sharpest public warner advocating for adequate equipment for the Bundeswehr and clear support for Ukraine at a time when many political colleagues were still banking on balance. The mamba does not wait until everyone agrees.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Sexual One: Fervor as a Drive</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The sexual One (SX1) does not direct its demand for perfection toward its own environment or society as a whole, but toward intensity: toward complete presence, complete honesty, complete consequence in what it recognizes as right. Naranjo called this subtype Zeal: a burning desire to separate the genuine from the false.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Strack-Zimmermann has lived out this pattern in the political arena like almost no one else. Her appearances in the Bundestag and on talk shows are known for her direct, uncompromising tone—she does not beat around the bush, she names things. She has no fear of unpopularity. When she is convinced that something is going wrong, she says it loudly, clearly, repeatedly. The SX1 cannot stomach half-answers to real questions.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Her commitment to supporting Ukraine was not tactical from the start, but moral: a country is attacked, a democracy is in danger, and anyone who sees that must act. That is not foreign policy. That is the inner law of the sexual One.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Nine Wing: Persistence as a Second Force</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The Nine wing (w9) lends the sexual One a quality that comes as a surprise at first sight: endurance. The Nine is patient. It holds out. Not because it is indifferent, but because it knows that some things take time and that continuity often accomplishes more than drama.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This wing explains why Strack-Zimmermann, despite all her willingness for confrontation, did not destabilize her party and coalitions. She fights—but she manages the fight strategically. The Nine wing brings a certain grounding to the intensity of the sexual One: not softer, but more steadfast. The mamba that is not only lightning-fast, but also waits patiently until the moment is right.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This combination—SX1 fire with w9 persistence—makes her a political fighter who does not exhaust herself. She burns, but she burns steadily.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Passion: Wrath as a Political Instrument</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The passion of the One is called wrath, and in the SX1w9 it is at once sharp and controlled. Strack-Zimmermann has no shyness about raising her voice or pointing her finger in public debates. When she gets the impression in the Bundestag that untruths are being told or responsibility is being refused, then comes the mamba.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This wrath is not personal. It is principle-based. It is directed against what is wrong, not against the person—even if the two are not always easy to distinguish from the outside. The Nine wing ensures that the wrath does not escalate uncontrollably, but is placed in the right spots. Precision instead of explosion.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Europe as a Larger Framework</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">In 2024, Strack-Zimmermann moved to the European Parliament and took over the chair of the Subcommittee on Security and Defence—this time on a European level. That is no career step; that is a consequence: the sexual One that recognized that the challenge is larger than a national arena.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The Nine wing shows itself here in its constructive side: the ability to think beyond borders, hold alliances, maintain continuity. The mamba on the European stage—the speed is the same, the radius of action larger.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Gift: Clarity as Protection</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">What Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann gives to political debate has become rare: clarity. Not simplification—clarity. The readiness to say what is, even when it is uncomfortable. The SX1w9 tolerates no vagueness when it comes to the essential.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">That is the gift of the Black Mamba with a Nine wing: it brings fire and steadfastness. It fights, and it holds out. In a time when political positions turn rapidly, that is no small offering.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Armadillo</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>armadillo</strong> is the animal of the social Type 4 &ndash; armored on the outside, soft within. Hardly any image fits Michael Jackson more precisely: an artist who appeared untouchable on stage &ndash; flawlessly choreographed, wrapped in glittering costumes, hidden behind a mask of perfection &ndash; and who, in interviews, repeatedly spoke of profound loneliness.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">No musician of the twentieth century redefined pop culture as completely. And hardly any musician spoke as openly, at the same time, about feeling like an outsider &ndash; within his own family, within his own fame, within his own skin. The armadillo shows the world its armor. What lies beneath it, it shows almost no one.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. Shame as Quiet Driving Force: The Stolen Childhood</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>social Type 4 (SO4)</strong> is the reinforcing type of the Four: it carries the passion of envy inward &ndash; as <strong>shame</strong>. The SO4's core feeling is a deep sense of lack: others have something taken for granted that I do not. In Michael Jackson, this feeling can be traced back to his earliest childhood.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Born in 1958 in Gary, Indiana, the seventh of nine children, he was already performing on stage at age five &ndash; first with his brothers in the Jackson 5, under the strict, often violent regime of his father, Joseph Jackson. Michael himself later repeatedly described being struck and berated as a child whenever a routine was not perfect. There was almost no room for play, for friendships, for an ordinary childhood. What other children took for granted, he never had: <em>I never really got the chance to be a child</em>, he said in several interviews. That is exactly the wound of the SO4 &ndash; not a lack of success, but a lack of something that seems normal for everyone else.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Neverland, the ranch he built as an adult &ndash; with a carousel, a zoo, a cinema, and a roller coaster &ndash; can be read from this perspective as an attempt to reclaim what was missing from his own childhood. The SO4 does not seek wealth for its own sake. It seeks what it never had.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Three-Wing: The Perfection of the Stage</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Three-wing (w3)</strong> gives the social Four something it would not have alone: stage presence, ambition, the ability to shape inner pain into flawless performance. The SO4w3 feels the shame &ndash; and performs anyway, with a precision that tolerates no error.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Michael Jackson's career is this combination in its purest form. <em>Thriller</em> (1982) became the best-selling album in history, with over 70 million copies sold. The moonwalk, first shown in 1983 at the Motown 25th Anniversary special, became an icon. Every routine, every music video, every stage performance was worked out to the smallest detail &ndash; rehearsals of ten or twelve hours were normal for him. The Three-wing supplies the discipline and ambition; the Four beneath it supplies the depth that turns pure perfection into genuine art.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">But the stage was more than a profession for Jackson. It was the one place he felt safe. <em>When I'm on stage, that's the only place I'm truly happy</em>, he once said. For the SO4w3, applause is not vanity &ndash; it is the brief relief of a feeling that otherwise never fully disappears.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Price of Visibility: Image and Transformation</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Over the decades, Jackson's outward appearance changed so fundamentally that it became a subject of discussion in itself &ndash; several surgeries on his nose and chin, an increasingly lighter skin tone that he later attributed to the skin condition <em>vitiligo</em>, a pigmentation disorder he made public in a 1993 interview with Oprah Winfrey. For years, the public responded with mockery rather than understanding.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">For the social Four, outward appearance is never neutral. It is the visible surface of an inner feeling of inadequacy &ndash; and an attempt to correct that very feeling from the outside. The deeper the shame, the greater the urge to keep working on one's own appearance until it finally feels right. In Jackson's case, this mechanism collided with unprecedented public scrutiny: every change was photographed, commented on, ridiculed &ndash; reinforcing exactly the feeling of never being quite right that the change was meant to soothe.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Light and Shadow</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SO4w3 is its ability to turn the deepest personal pain into something that touches millions &ndash; and to transform it into a cause that reaches beyond the self. Jackson founded the <em>Heal the World Foundation</em>, and according to several estimates donated hundreds of millions of dollars to charitable causes over the course of his career, publicly advocating for children in need. For the SO4, this is no contradiction to its own neediness, but its most direct expression: giving what one missed the most.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The shadow of his life cannot be set aside: in 1993, he was first accused of sexually abusing a child; the case was settled out of court without any finding of guilt. In 2005, Jackson stood trial on similar charges and was acquitted on all counts. After his death, two men raised renewed, serious allegations from their childhoods in the documentary <em>Leaving Neverland</em> (2019). The truth behind these conflicting accounts cannot be resolved within the scope of this portrait &ndash; it remains a matter of public dispute. What can be described from an Enneagram perspective is only the pattern: a man who, throughout his life, tried to reclaim his own lost childhood in the company of children &ndash; in a way that some found touching and others found deeply troubling.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. Death and Legacy</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Michael Jackson died on June 25, 2009, in Los Angeles at the age of 50 from acute cardiac arrest, caused by an overdose of the anesthetic propofol administered by his personal physician, Conrad Murray, to treat his insomnia &ndash; just weeks before the planned start of his comeback concert series <em>This Is It</em> in London. Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in 2011.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">What remains is a musical legacy that still shapes pop culture today, and a biography that shows how closely genius and pain can be intertwined in the social Four with a Three-wing. The armadillo wore its armor until the very end &ndash; gleaming, untouchable, admired by millions. What lay beneath it remained, for the most part, hidden to the last.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The twenty-five-year chain of pain medication, insomnia, and ultimately fatal propofol dependence is explored in full in the separate <a href="javascript:void(0)" data-route="krankheitsportraets-michael-jackson">illness portrait on Jackson</a>.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Golden Retriever Who Wanted to Embrace a Continent</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Claudio Naranjo, the founder of the modern Enneagram subtype teaching, classified Napoleon Bonaparte in his seminars and writings as belonging to the <strong>social Two</strong> &ndash; the Golden Retriever, who seeks connection, significance, and admiration. At first glance this is surprising: the popular Enneagram school would intuitively place Napoleon at Type 8 (the Challenger) or Type 3 (the Achiever). But Naranjo looked deeper, at the passion and fixation behind the action &ndash; and the social Two is, at its core, by no means only the reserved helper in the background. She strives for influence, significance, and admiration on the grandest possible stage, driven by <strong>pride</strong> and the unconscious wish to be indispensable and powerful.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Born in 1769 on Corsica into an impoverished but proud noble family, the French general Napoleon's social rise did not come through withdrawal and calculation, but through sheer personal impact: he knew his soldiers' names, addressed them directly, let himself be seen in their midst, shared their hardships. Where a purely power-driven type would have cultivated distance and fear, Napoleon invested in relationship &ndash; and it was precisely this ability to bind entire armies to himself that was the real reason for his unparalleled rise from provincial Corsican officer to Emperor of the French.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. SO2: Ambition as a Form of Love</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Naranjo called the social Two <strong>ambition</strong> &ndash; and in Napoleon this ambition fuses inseparably with the longing for admiration and belonging. He wanted not merely to serve France: he wanted to be the indispensable one, without whom nothing could proceed, the father of the nation, the savior of the revolution from itself. His enormous perfectionism in self-presentation &ndash; from the coronation painting to the carefully composed bulletins from the front &ndash; was far more than mere propaganda. It was the SO2 reflex in raw form: whoever is admired belongs. Whoever is indispensable will not be abandoned.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This same logic runs through his entire work as ruler: the reform of the education system, theestablishment of a merit-based civil service, the founding of the Legion of Honor as recognition for merit rather than noble birth. Each of these measures was simultaneously statecraft and an offer to the people: <em>I take care of you. I see your achievement. You belong to me.</em></p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Three-Wing: Staging in the Service of Connection</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Three-Wing (w3)</strong> turned the connection-seeking benefactor into a master of self-presentation. Napoleon's boundless desire for recognition, his coronation as emperor in the presence of the Pope, his deliberate self-styling as heir to the Roman Caesars, his focus on success, status, and outward splendor, and his enormous organizational efficiency &ndash; all of this bears the signature of the Three-Wing. His most famous civilizational legacy, the <em>Code Napoléon</em>, was at once a legal masterpiece and a monument to himself: a body of law that bears his name and still resonates in parts of Europe today.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">At the same time, this wing carries the same danger as in every SO2w3: the confusion of public image with inner core. The more honors Napoleon accepted &ndash; the imperial crown, the reshaping of all Europe in his image, the marriage to a Habsburg archduchess for dynastic legitimacy &ndash; the more the role of the indispensable benefactor merged with that of a ruler who tolerated no equals beside him. Energetically, this development can already be read here as a precursor of the stress point at Eight: under sustained stress, people gradually take on the behavior patterns of their stress-point type over time, without ever becoming that type themselves.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. Waterloo and St. Helena: When the Golden Retriever Was Abandoned</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The years 1812 to 1815 form a typological document of shattering clarity. The Russian campaign, the Battle of Leipzig, and finally Waterloo &ndash; each of these defeats came with the gradual withdrawal of allies and marshals whom Napoleon had personally elevated and endowed with titles, lands, and trust. For the social Two, this is precisely the deepest conceivable break: the people one raised up to secure connection turn away when the tide turns.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Even the path there shows the Two's typical stress point: under pressure, Type 2 moves into its <strong>stress point at Eight</strong> &ndash; and precisely this pattern runs through Napoleon's final years of rule. The charismatic general who secured connection through personal closeness increasingly became a man who fought ever more ruthlessly for control, rejected advice, and burned through France's youth in one campaign after another. The final exile to St. Helena &ndash; far from any stage, any audience, any possibility of acting and being loved again &ndash; struck the social Two at its most vulnerable point: isolation without any connection at all.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Energetic Effect: A Magnet for Loyalty</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Napoleon's effect on his contemporaries carried a rare magnetism: soldiers followed him for years through cold, hunger, and danger, because he marched with them himself, shared their deprivations, and returned their loyalty with palpable, personal attention. When he returned from exile on Elba in 1815, his mere appearance was enough to turn entire regiments &ndash; sent to arrest him &ndash; to his side without a shot fired: an almost unparalleled historical proof of personal binding power.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">And yet: behind this magnetism lay the long shadow of the Two, the passion of <strong>pride</strong> &ndash; the belief that one must be needed and admired to be of value, and the difficulty of ever having enough. Napoleon had fame, power, the admiration of a continent &ndash; and still that same inner logic drove him further: to one more campaign, one more crown, one more gesture of grandeur. Whether he would have been loved without all of it likely remained unanswerable even to himself.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Gift: Institutions That Endured</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">What Napoleon left the world cannot be reduced to military campaigns. The Code Napoléon still shapes civil law across large parts of Europe and Latin America today. He reformed France's education system, administration, and tax system so fundamentally that many of these structures persist into the present. The Legion of Honor, which recognized merit rather than birth, was a deeply SO2-typical gesture: defining belonging through achievement rather than origin, including people who would never have belonged before.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Here the SO2w3 reaches its greatest scope: a person whose personal need for significance and belonging transformed into institutions that outlasted centuries. The Golden Retriever with the Three-Wing can reorder a continent &ndash; if he learns that true belonging need not be conquered, nor secured through ever-new proof, but simply is.</p>

        <p class="krim-portrait-typ">SX8w7 &middot; Sexual Type 8 with Seven-wing</p>
        <p class="krim-portrait-subtitle">French painter, 1848&ndash;1903 &ndash; Animal correspondence: Crocodile</p>
      </div>
      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Crocodile</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>crocodile</strong> is the animal of the Sexual Type 8 – it does not wait to see whether a territory is owed to it, it takes it. Paul Gauguin lived exactly by that principle: at thirty-six, without hesitation, he left a secure bourgeois career, his wife, and five children to devote himself entirely to painting – not a gradual transition, but a single, decisive cut. In established Enneagram literature, Gauguin is usually classified as a Four, the romantically suffering, misunderstood artist. His actual behavior, however – the uncompromising conquest of new territory, the cool boundary-setting toward closeness, the open defiance of every authority right up to his death – paints the picture of a Sexual Eight with a Seven-wing.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">What the crocodile seizes, it holds onto. What it no longer wants, it drops without looking back. Gauguin's life – from the Paris stock exchange floor through provincial Brittany, Panama, Arles, and finally the South Seas – reads like a chain of exactly such seizures and such abrupt breaks.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. Peru: An Early Foreignness</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Paul Gauguin was born in 1848 in Paris, into a politically engaged family: his maternal grandmother, Flora Tristan, was a well-known early socialist writer and advocate for women's rights. Because of the political unrest following Napoleon III's coup, the family fled to Peru in 1849, to relatives on his mother's side; his father died during the crossing. Gauguin spent his first seven years in Lima, in a wealthy household staffed with servants, before the family returned to France in 1855.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This early experience of a foreign, exotically lived world – and its abrupt loss upon returning to bourgeois France – left Gauguin with a lifelong restlessness that never settled contentedly on a single place. At seventeen he joined the merchant marine, traveled South America and the Mediterranean, and later served in the French navy – early signs of a pattern that would repeat throughout his life: moving on as soon as a place had lost its appeal.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Stock Exchange That Grew Too Narrow</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">After his naval service, Gauguin became a stockbroker in Paris in 1871, married the Dane Mette Gad in 1873, and lived for over a decade a financially comfortable bourgeois life with five children. On the side, he began painting, collected Impressionist works, met Camille Pissarro, and exhibited with the Impressionists from 1879 onward. The stock market crash of 1882 hit him hard – yet rather than reestablishing himself in finance, Gauguin used the crisis as the occasion for a radical cut: in 1884/85 he gave up the profession entirely.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">He sent Mette and the children to her family in Copenhagen and devoted himself from then on entirely to painting – without reliable income, without a secure future. For the Sexual Eight, this is no act of desperation but a sovereign act of boundary-drawing: bourgeois life was a territory that no longer satisfied his appetite, so he left it, without prolonged negotiation.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Sexual Eight: Possession</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Sexual Eight (SX8)</strong> is the subtype Naranjo called <em>Possession</em>. It does not want a distanced connection but complete fusion – with a person, a place, an idea. What it touches, it wants entirely. Gauguin lived this out in his painting as much as in his relationships: he claimed for himself an entirely new, self-defined artistic language – flat color, symbolic imagery, a deliberate break from the Impressionist rendering of the visible world – and claimed this authority without asking for approval.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The same pattern showed unmistakably in his relationships: in Tahiti and later the Marquesas, Gauguin entered several relationships with very young local women, including fourteen-year-old Teha'amana, whom he later romanticized in "Noa Noa." He contracted syphilis and demonstrably passed the disease on to several partners – behavior that shows the shadow side of SX8 possession in its starkest form: closeness is taken, not negotiated, with little regard for the consequences for others.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. The Seven-wing: Restless Conquest</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Seven-wing</strong> gives the Sexual Eight an appetite and curiosity for the next territory as soon as the previous one has been conquered. Hardly any artist's life shows this restlessness as clearly as Gauguin's endless chain of departures: the Breton artists' colony at Pont-Aven; in 1887 a grueling, self-chosen stint of manual labor on the Panama Canal to fund his travels; then Martinique; in 1888 Arles; in 1891 his first voyage to Tahiti; in 1893 a brief, financially disastrous return to France; in 1895 his final departure for the South Seas; and finally the Marquesas island of Hiva Oa.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">A Sexual Eight with a Nine-wing would likely have settled somewhere and put down roots. Gauguin did the opposite: as soon as a place lost its appeal or disappointed his expectations, he moved on – not out of despair, but from the same appetite for the next, still-untouched territory that had driven him since his days as a young sailor.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. Arles: Van Gogh and the Eight's Boundary</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">In October 1888, after months of urging, Gauguin followed Vincent van Gogh's (SP4w5) invitation to Arles, where Van Gogh dreamed of a shared artists' colony in the "Yellow House." Van Gogh, whose Self-Preservation Four sought to process its deepest emotional life through intense closeness, experienced their nine weeks together as passionate, often all-night debates about art. Gauguin, by contrast, increasingly felt that same intensity as an imposition – contemporary accounts describe him growing reserved, distant, and increasingly irritated during this period.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This is the decisive difference between the two subtypes: a Four would have responded to the closeness with its own suffering or by withdrawing into its inner world. The Eight responds with boundary-setting – cool, controlled, refusing to be swept up in the other's emotional intensity. On the evening of December 23, 1888, the tension escalated; Gauguin left Arles immediately afterward, while Van Gogh cut off part of his own ear that same night. Gauguin himself remained conspicuously detached about the event for the rest of his life – further evidence of an Eight that does not lose its own control even in a dramatic crisis, even as it had long since lost control of the situation itself.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">7. Tahiti and the Marquesas: A Final Resistance</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">In his final years on the Marquesas Islands, Gauguin entered open, public conflict with the colonial administration and the Catholic Church – defending the local population against taxes and regulations he considered unjust, publishing his own deliberately provocative satirical broadsheet called "Le Sourire," and repeatedly facing legal disputes over it, eventually risking imprisonment. Even seriously ill, he did not give up this resistance.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This too is characteristically SX8: the Eight does not shy away from confronting authority, even when it can no longer objectively win. Not the quiet, inward-turned suffering of a Four, but an open fight against a power it experiences as illegitimate, waged to the very end.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">8. Light and Shadow</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SX8w7 is its uncompromising power of renewal: Gauguin broke with the Impressionist rendering of the visible world and opened painting's path to Symbolism and modernism – a rupture that directly influenced later artists such as Matisse and the Fauvists. His willingness to give up a secure bourgeois life entirely in order to follow his own artistic vision testifies to exactly the uncompromising quality that defines the Sexual Eight.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The shadow is the same trait, without regard for those left behind: an abandoned family, underage partners in colonial dependency, a disease he knowingly passed on. The mature SX8w7 learns to replace possession with genuine connection. In Gauguin's case, as far as the sources show, that step was largely never taken.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">9. Death and Legacy</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Paul Gauguin died in 1903, weakened by syphilis and other ailments, alone in his hut on Hiva Oa – still in open conflict with the colonial administration, unyielding to the end. No conciliatory retreat, no quiet surrender: the crocodile defended its territory to its last breath.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">What remains is a body of work that fundamentally changed art history – and a biography that shows what the same force is capable of: one of the most consequential artistic innovations of the modern era, and the ruthless exhaustion of those who came too close to him, Vincent van Gogh foremost among them. The Sexual Eight with a Seven-wing knows no half measures – neither in departing nor in seizing.</p>

        <p class="krim-portrait-subtitle">Singer, entrepreneur, b. 1988, Barbados – Animal equivalent: Chihuahua</p>
      </div>
      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Chihuahua from Barbados</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The Chihuahua is the smallest dog breed in the world—and the animal least impressed by that fact. It barks when it wants to. It stands its ground when it wants to. It does not allow itself to be intimidated by size, by loudness, or by expectations. Yet behind this feistiness lies no mere bravado—but a creature of deep sensitivity that has learned to protect itself by showing no vulnerability. The Chihuahua loves intensely, suffers passionately, and holds fast to what it trusts.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Robyn Rihanna Fenty hails from Bridgetown, Barbados—a small Caribbean island that the world barely had on its radar when a 15-year-old girl auditioned for an American music producer. What followed is one of the most remarkable ascents in the history of pop music: from a child in the Caribbean to the most global entertainer of her generation, to an entrepreneur who built a billion-dollar industry—all while never ceasing to be herself. That is the Chihuahua: small in origin. Unstoppable wherever it goes.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Rihanna's childhood was no idyll. Her father struggled with alcohol and drug addiction, and her parents separated when she was eleven years old. The great cities of the world—New York, Los Angeles, London—were as distant to her then as another planet. What she had was a voice, a drive, and a willingness to do whatever it took. That is not luck. That is the raw material from which the Sexual Four is made.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Sexual Four: Rivalry as a Life Principle</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">In the Enneagram tradition, the Sexual Four (SX4) is the subtype that does not turn the Four's pain inward, but directs it outward—as intensity, as longing, as fire. Naranjo called this subtype Rivalry: the burning conviction that others possess what has been withheld from oneself—and the drive to surpass, outdo, and outshine them. This is no petty envy. It is the engine of a person who senses her own depth and knows: I deserve more than what was allotted to me.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This energy is palpable throughout Rihanna's work. "Umbrella" is no simple anthem—it is a promise of radical loyalty under conditions that would make others run away. "We Found Love" celebrates a feeling so vast it almost hurts. "Diamonds" speaks of a longing that refuses to diminish itself. And "Stay"—one of the most personal songs in her catalog—reveals a woman capable of falling in love with something destructive, knowing it, and staying anyway: the paradox of the SX4, ground between longing and reason, yet refusing to yield.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The chapter surrounding Chris Brown (2009) cannot be bypassed if one wishes to understand Rihanna. Chris Brown was then—like Rihanna—a young R&B star, and the two had been in a public relationship since 2008. On the night before the 2009 Grammy Awards, he physically assaulted her in a car, injuring her severely. The incident was reported, Brown pleaded guilty—and the photo of Rihanna's injuries leaked to the press went around the world. She was 21 years old.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The SX4 does not keep its wounds hidden like the SP4—it is confronted with them visibly, whether it wants to be or not. Rihanna did not cower afterward. She rebuilt herself—with anger, with pain, with the album "Rated R," which cuts like a blade: dark, edgy, unvarnished. That is SX4: pain is not buried. It becomes art.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Three Wing: Feeling Becomes a Brand</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The Three wing (w3) grants the Sexual Four something crucial: the ability not merely to feel one's own experience, but to shape it—and turn it into impact. Where an SX4 with a weaker Three wing might drown in the fire of its own emotions, the Three wing introduces ambition, craft, and a fine instinct for what works. This combination turns intense experience into a career—and a career into an empire.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The w3 is evident throughout Rihanna's aesthetic evolution: the precise calculation of an image that morphed with every album. From the sweet Caribbean pop newcomer, to the agitated, dark energy of "Rated R," to the carefree sensuality of "Loud," and ultimately to the mature, uncompromising mastery of "Anti"—every era was a conscious reinvention. The SX4 feels genuine. The w3 ensures that what is genuine lands effectively.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This becomes particularly clear in "Anti" (2016), Rihanna's seventh and to date last studio album. It is the first to carry her vision entirely: no radio-format compromises, no predictable single structures. "Anti" sounds like someone who has stopped asking for permission. That is the finest gift the Three wing can offer the SX4: the tools to forge one's innermost self into a form no one can ignore.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. Fenty Beauty and the Revolution of Beauty</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">In 2017, Rihanna reshaped the cosmetics industry with a single product launch: Fenty Beauty—40 foundation shades, ranging from porcelain to the deepest rich brown. What sounds self-evident today was not then: for decades, the industry had treated darker skin tones as a niche or ignored them altogether. Rihanna did not frame this as a marketing strategy. She treated it as an absolute matter of course—and thereby exposed the absurdity of the industry.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This gesture deeply reflects the pattern of the SX4w3: the SX4 knows from personal experience what it means not to be seen. The SX4 from Barbados, who faced a beauty ideal at every turn that failed to reflect her face, did not forget that experience—she transformed it into a business model. And the Three wing ensured that this model was executed with such precision and consistency that competitors were forced to follow suit within months.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Savage X Fenty, her lingerie line, extended the same vision: all body types, all skin tones, all sizes as the norm—not the exception. That is not merely good intentions. That is vision. And her short-lived yet historically significant fashion house Fenty under LVMH (the conglomerate's first new fashion house since Christian Lacroix in 1987) demonstrated that Rihanna does not think in categories—she thinks in levels.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Light and Shadow: The Fire That Sustains</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The existential trap of the Four is envy—not as malice, but as the profound sense that others possess a completeness one lacks. In the SX4, this envy takes on a sharper, more personal countenance: "You have what was withheld from me—and I will surpass you." This engine has driven Rihanna far. But it also carries a cost.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The years between "Anti" (2016) and her Super Bowl performance (2023) marked seven years of silence as a recording artist—seven years during which Rihanna gave birth to children, ran enterprises, and felt no compulsion to return to music until it was strictly on her own terms. When she stepped onto the stage at Super Bowl LVII—visibly pregnant after a seven-year hiatus, alone on a floating platform, surrounded by half a dozen giant screens and no guest stars—it was a statement requiring no words: "I need no permission. I appear when I am ready."</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SX4w3 resides in this capacity for complete self-determination—even at the price of being misunderstood. The shadow lies in the danger of turning the fire inward: when rivalry turns against oneself, when expectations overwhelm, when intensity loses its direction. Rihanna has known both. And thus far, she has returned every single time.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Chihuahua Who Belongs to Herself</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The healing path of the Four leads from the question "Why am I not like the others?" to the realization "What I am is unique—and it is mine." For the SX4w3, this means not abandoning rivalry, but purifying it: no longer fighting to prove oneself, but creating because one has something to say. This shift is quiet—yet it changes everything.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This path can be discerned throughout Rihanna's biography. The early singer fought battles—with the industry, with the public, with the expectations imposed upon her. The later Rihanna stopped fighting and began creating. Fenty Beauty is no crusade against the beauty industry—it is a vision of what beauty could be. "Anti" is no protest against commercial radio—it is a proposal of what music can be when one stops asking for permission.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The Chihuahua from Bridgetown did not conquer the world through physical stature. It transformed it through intensity—by refusing to be smaller than it is, and by a readiness to reveal precisely what most would conceal. What remains is a voice, a face, and a stance that cannot be forgotten. That is the Sexual Four with a Three wing. That is Rihanna.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Raccoon</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>raccoon</strong> is the animal of the Self-Preservation Three – an animal that works with tireless diligence out of sight before it shows itself, and that draws its security from demonstrable craft. Serdar Somuncu was born in 1968 in Istanbul and moved to Germany with his family as a toddler, growing up in Neuss. Before becoming known as a comedian, he underwent thorough musical and acting training: from 1984 to 1986 he studied at the Conservatory of Music in Maastricht, from 1986 to 1992 percussion at the State University of Music in Wuppertal, and from 1992 to 1995 acting and directing in Frankfurt am Main.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">He directed more than 100 stage plays before his actual public breakthrough came – years of disciplined, often invisible groundwork before the work that would truly become publicly visible.</p>

        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Self-Preservation Three (SP3)</strong> is the countertype of the Three – the subtype that seeks security not through public image but through demonstrable, verifiable competence. Naranjo called this subtype <em>Security</em>: one is not admired for selling oneself well, but for actually delivering what one promises. Somuncu's 1996 breakthrough with his staged reading of Hitler's "Mein Kampf" was not a crude publicity stunt but a dramaturgically precise engagement meant to take the "horror out of the text through confrontation."</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">His own stated aim was clear: "Whoever laughs at Mein Kampf has understood what nonsense is in there." More than 1,500 performances followed across Europe, reaching over half a million viewers – not a short-lived provocation, but a body of work sustained across decades, whose effect only fully unfolded through steady repetition and craft precision.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Two-wing: Performing Despite Personal Risk</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Two-wing (w2)</strong> gives the Self-Preservation Three a genuine impulse to commit to others, even at personal cost. Because of the "Mein Kampf" readings, Somuncu repeatedly received threats from neo-Nazis and at times performed under police protection and wearing a bulletproof vest – not a one-time incident, but a strain sustained over years that he accepted because he was convinced of his work's impact.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">That conviction was confirmed: to this day, Somuncu receives letters from people who describe the readings as a decisive turning point in their lives. Here the Two-wing shows itself not as mere charm, but as a concrete, decades-maintained connection to an audience genuinely changed by his work.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Bulletproof Vest as Symbol</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Rather than ending the readings after the first threats, Somuncu chose to continue under heightened security – a sober, hardly glamorous decision that was no public heroic pose, but the consistent continuation of work he had recognized as right, under adverse conditions.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This episode shows the typical SP3w2 stance: no grand public gesture, but the quiet, persistent continuation of a task whose value is measured by actual results – security and substance, not showmanship, even under threat.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Light and Shadow of the Self-Preservation Three</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SP3w2 lies in the ability to <strong>combine thorough craft preparation with genuine commitment to others</strong> – Somuncu's decades of musical and acting training formed the foundation for a body of work that directly reached and demonstrably changed over half a million people across Europe.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The Three's fatal flaw is <strong>vanity</strong> – subtler in the SP3 than in the louder Three subtypes, but present nonetheless: the need to keep confirming one's own worth through ever-new, verifiable impact. Somuncu's consistent commitment to a risky format sustained for decades shows how much strength it takes to hold on to one's own standard of substance even under external pressure.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Legacy: The Raccoon That Made Enlightenment a Life's Work</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Serdar Somuncu is among the most defining figures of German comedy – not because of a single provocative act, but because of a craft-grounded body of work sustained across decades that combined historical enlightenment with artistic precision.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">From a classically trained percussionist, through a director of more than a hundred stage plays, to a comedian who read from "Mein Kampf" more than 1,500 times, at times wearing a bulletproof vest: this is the Self-Preservation Three with a Two-wing in its most mature form – substance that does not exhaust itself in provocation, but continues into real, decades-proven impact.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Cheetah Who Founded a Realm of Convents</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>cheetah</strong> is the animal of the social Three &ndash; the fastest animal on earth, built for visible, undeniable success. Few historical figures outside politics or the stage embody this pattern as vividly as Teresa of Ávila. With chronically fragile health, in an era when women were barely permitted to appear in public at all, she built a network of seventeen reformed convents across Spain within two decades &ndash; an institutional achievement that even healthy men of her time would have struggled to match.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The Spanish mystic Teresa of Ávila, born in 1515 in Ávila, the daughter of a wealthy merchant family with Jewish roots, entered the Carmelite order at twenty against her father's wishes. But ordinary convent life soon wasn't enough for her. She didn't want merely to be a nun &ndash; she wanted to renew the order, visibly, tangibly, irrefutably. The cheetah does not stay back with the pack. It sprints ahead while others keep to their accustomed pace.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. SO3: Reform as Visible Work</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>social Three (SO3)</strong> does not live for isolated, private achievements &ndash; it needs a work that becomes publicly visible and lasts. Naranjo described this subtype as the one in which ambition most unmistakably merges with the need for recognition by a larger whole. In Teresa, this ambition was directed not at personal fame in the worldly sense, but at a goal that was greater still: the reform of an entire order, visible in stone, rule, and community.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Her journeys across Spain, often in a rickety ox-cart, frequently ill, always under time pressure to found yet another convent, are SO3 energy in its rawest form: she did not wait for ideal conditions. She built institutions &ndash; the <em>Convento de San José</em> in Ávila in 1562 as the first, then Medina del Campo, Malagón, Valladolid, Toledo, and onward, until her work spread a visible, undeniable network across the entire country. Every new convent was a proof: <em>The reform is alive. It works. It can no longer be ignored.</em></p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Four-Wing: The Innermost Castle of the Soul</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Four-wing (w4)</strong> gives the social Three a depth that exceeds pure institutional achievement &ndash; the need to be perceived as a unique, unmistakable inner world, not merely as a reformer. This depth shows itself precisely in Teresa's writings: <em>The Interior Castle</em> describes the soul as a crystalline palace with seven nested chambers, through which a person advances toward union with God &ndash; an image of poetic, almost literary symbolic power, far removed from dry dogmatics.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Her mystical experiences carried an intensity she herself could barely put into words &ndash; above all the so-called <em>transverberation</em>: the vision of an angel piercing her heart with a golden, fire-tipped spear, a pain so sweet that, as she wrote, she would have wished it to last forever. Two generations later, Gian Lorenzo Bernini immortalized this moment in his marble sculpture <em>The Ecstasy of Saint Teresa</em> &ndash; a work still celebrated today as one of the most significant sacred artworks in Europe, and still debated for its openly sensual depiction. The innermost, most personal experience of the Four-winged mystic became the most public artwork of her age.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Years of Paralysis: When the Cheetah Could No Longer Run</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">At twenty-three, Teresa suffered a severe illness, likely a form of catalepsy, that left her in a death-like rigid state for months &ndash; for a time she was thought dead, and a grave had already been prepared. Afterward she remained partially paralyzed for over three years, unable to walk unassisted. For the social Three, whose worth is defined through visible achievement, complete physical helplessness is one of the deepest conceivable crises: the cheetah that can no longer run is, for a moment, no cheetah at all.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">It is precisely in this period that the typical stress point of the Three shows itself: under pressure, Type 3 moves into its <strong>Nine stress point</strong> &ndash; withdrawal, self-doubt, a disappearance from one's own capacity to act. For decades, Teresa was accompanied by tormenting self-doubt over whether her mystical experiences truly came from God or, as she herself feared, might have been inspired by the devil. She repeatedly submitted to examination by confessors and came under the scrutiny of the Spanish Inquisition, which kept her <em>Vida</em>, her autobiography, under seal for years before releasing it.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">She wrote this autobiography explicitly on the instruction of her spiritual advisors &ndash; so that they, and if necessary the Inquisition itself, could judge her orthodoxy. The social Three, who needs recognition from a larger whole, thereby submitted herself to the harshest public scrutiny available in her era &ndash; and passed it.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Energetic Effect: Speed in the Service of Renewal</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Teresa's effect on her contemporaries was marked by nearly unstoppable momentum: she founded, negotiated, wrote letters to kings and bishops, and kept traveling even when feverish and exhausted. Contemporaries described a woman of sharp intellect, practical organizational talent, and a dry, often self-deprecating humor &ndash; no distant saint, but an energetic reformer who overcame resistance with the same determination she applied to physical obstacles.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">And yet: behind this momentum lay the long shadow of the Three, the passion of <strong>vanity</strong> &ndash; not in the sense of ostentation, but as the constant need to prove one's own work orthodox, successful, unimpeachable. Teresa had to prove, her entire life, that she was no fraud, no heretic, none of the numerous <em>alumbradas</em> the Inquisition pursued in those decades. Whether she would have found the same clarity about her own inner world without this constant pressure to justify herself remains an open question.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Gift: A Language for the Innermost Self</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">What Teresa of Ávila left the world cannot be reduced to seventeen convent foundations. With <em>The Interior Castle</em>, <em>The Way of Perfection</em>, and her autobiography, she created one of the most striking languages for mystical experience in the history of world literature &ndash; written by a woman, in an age when women were almost entirely barred from theological writing. In 1970, nearly four hundred years after her death, she was named &ndash; together with Catherine of Siena &ndash; the first woman ever to be declared a <em>Doctor of the Church</em>, the highest recognition the Catholic Church grants for theological work.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This is the SO3w4 at its farthest-reaching level: a woman whose need for visible, unimpeachable recognition merged with a depth that outlasted centuries. The cheetah with the Four-wing can refound an entire spiritual tradition &ndash; once it learns that the innermost self it tries to protect works most powerfully precisely when it is shared.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Hippopotamus</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The hippopotamus is the animal of the Self-Preservation Two—and Uli Hoeneß is this animal in its most uncompromising expression. The hippopotamus needs no audience. It needs its territory: the water it knows, the riverbanks that belong to it, the boundaries it marks and defends with every gram of its body. It seems good-natured—until someone gets too close. Then it shows what it is truly made of.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The German football executive Uli Hoeneß has been FC Bayern Munich for over fifty years. Not as an employee, not as an official—but as a human being who understood this club as his territory and built it with an energy unparalleled in German football history. He won as a player, built as a manager, led as president—and after the deepest fall of his life, he returned. The hippopotamus stands up.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Self-Preservation Two: Caretaking as a Survival Principle</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The Self-Preservation Two (SP2) is the subtype of Type Two that directs its energy most directly toward its own survival and the survival of those closest to it. Naranjo called this subtype "Me First": the Two that names its own needs, knows and protects its territory—not through withdrawal, but through presence. The SP2 is the most concrete, down-to-earth, least romanticized of the three Type Two variants. It acts. It cares. It secures.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In Uli Hoeneß, this shows in a form of care that is not abstract, but personal and tangible. He called players in crisis, helped families, personally accompanied transfers, resolved conflicts—not because it was in the job description, but because that was how he understood it: FC Bayern is a family, and he is the one holding this family together. This kind of care is no weakness. It is power—the power of someone who knows that cohesion is the foundation of everything.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Yet Hoeneß was never a man of grand gestures for show. What he did, he did directly, often discreetly, sometimes gruffly. That is the SP2: no elegant diplomacy, but the immediate intervention of someone who feels responsible—and does not delegate that sense of responsibility.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Three Wing: Success as Second Nature</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The Three wing (w3) gives the Self-Preservation Two something the pure SP2 does not possess on its own: the hunger for measurable success, for results, for proof that one's own work is effective. The Three measures itself by numbers, titles, victories. It needs proof—not for others, but for itself. Combined with the SP2, it creates someone who is simultaneously deeply caring and relentlessly goal-oriented.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Uli Hoeneß transformed FC Bayern from a solid Bundesliga club into one of the most financially and athletically successful football clubs in the world. He did not articulate this as a mere vision—he did it. Annual titles, Champions League victories, record revenues, world-class transfers. The Three wing permits no mediocrity. It always asks: How good was that really? And can it be even better?</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">But this wing also has its shadow. The Three wing of the SP2 tends to equate success with self-worth: I am what I achieve. When performance fails to materialize, when control slips away, the foundation can shake. The tax evasion affair in 2013 was not just a legal problem for Hoeneß—it was a rupture in the image he had of himself: the man who has everything under control.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Passion: Pride as a Driving Force</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The passion of Type Two is pride—and in the SP2w3, this pride takes a special form: It is directed not toward personal admiration, but toward the work itself. Toward what was created through one's own hands, through decades of commitment, through the sum of all decisions. This pride is justified—and at the same time, it is a trap when it becomes the condition for one's self-worth.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Uli Hoeneß did not view FC Bayern as a job. He understood it as his life's work. That is the pride of the SP2w3 in its clearest expression: no narcissism, but the deep conviction that what one built is unique—and that one is indispensable for its preservation. This conviction drove him. And it made it hard for him to let go.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. The Fall and the Return: The Hippopotamus Stands Up</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The tax affair of 2013 and the subsequent prison sentence—three and a half years, of which he served about half—was a turning point that might have broken anyone else. Hoeneß faced the proceedings, admitted his guilt publicly, accepted the punishment. That cannot be taken for granted. It is the SP2 in its mature form: taking responsibility—even when it hurts.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">What followed his release was the chapter that perhaps defines him most. He returned—not triumphantly, but grounded. He assumed the office of president once again. FC Bayern welcomed him back. The hippopotamus had returned to the water. And whoever thought he would come back diminished had underestimated the animal.</p>

        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">What Uli Hoeneß gave to German football—and to FC Bayern Munich in particular—cannot be reduced to titles. He showed that a football club can be more than a business model: a community with conviction, loyalty, and a self-image that extends beyond the season. Players who fell into crisis spoke of him like a father. Employees stayed for decades because they knew someone stood up for them. That is the gift of the SP2w3: loyalty that carries.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The hippopotamus protects its territory—but it also protects those who live within it. Uli Hoeneß did not build FC Bayern for himself. He built it for what he saw in it: a community that endures. That is his life's work. And little will change that—even if the hippopotamus eventually changes its river course.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Hippopotamus</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>hippopotamus</strong> is the animal of the self-preservation Two &ndash; a creature that appears playful and good-natured from the outside, yet asserts itself with unexpected force the moment its territory or its own are threatened. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart rarely fit the image of the otherworldly, floating genius that posterity has made of him &ndash; he was a man of enormous directness, physical zest for life, and a very concrete sense of what he needed in order to survive.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The Austrian composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, born in 1756 in Salzburg, was paraded through the courts of Europe from age six by his father Leopold, himself a composer and ambitious manager of his son's career &ndash; Paris, London, The Hague, Italy. A child who had to learn to secure his own and his family's survival through his talent before he ever knew a childhood outside the stage.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. Self-Preservation Two: Care as a Survival Principle</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Naranjo called the <strong>self-preservation Two (SP2)</strong> <em>Me First</em>: the Two who knows and names her own needs, who cares for the survival of herself and those closest to her &ndash; concretely, directly, without much detour. Mozart's letters are full of this: he cared intensely for his wife Constanze, for friends in need, for students he taught free of charge even while in financial distress himself.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">At the same time, Mozart was one of the most uninhibited letter writers in music history: the so-called "Bäsle letters" to his cousin Maria Anna Thekla overflow with crude, scatological humor &ndash; a directness that had nothing to do with courtly etiquette and everything to do with the immediate, physical zest for life of the SP2. Care and exuberance lay close together in him, both expressions of the same earthy presence.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Three-Wing: Proof on the Stage</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Three-wing (w3)</strong> gives the self-preservation Two a hunger for visible, measurable success &ndash; the stage, the applause, the proof of one's own indispensability. In 1781 Mozart publicly broke with the Archbishop of Salzburg to establish himself as a freelance artist in Vienna &ndash; a gamble only someone confident in their own market value would take.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In Vienna he organized his own subscription concerts, composed piano concertos at a relentless pace to perform as soloist himself, and sought his whole life the most prestigious court appointment he could secure. The Three-wing of the SP2 asks not only "How do I secure survival?" but also "How do I prove I am the best?" &ndash; and Mozart proved it, work after work, often at dizzying speed. He is said to have written the overture to "Don Giovanni" the night before its premiere.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Passion: Pride Between Genius and Existential Fear</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The passion of the Two is called <strong>pride</strong> &ndash; in the SP2w3, directed at one's own ability and its visible yield. Mozart knew his worth and stated it confidently, sometimes to the irritation of his contemporaries. Yet this pride stood in constant tension with a very real financial insecurity: despite considerable income, he often lived beyond his means, repeatedly sending begging letters for loans to his fellow Freemason Michael Puchberg in his final years.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This is the flip side of the SP2w3: when one's own worth hangs on visible success, every dry spell becomes an existential threat. Mozart did not compensate with withdrawal but with even more work, more compositions, more performances &ndash; the hippopotamus defending its territory, if need be, through sheer endurance.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Bach, Beethoven, and Schubert: Encounters Across Time</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">In the early 1780s, Mozart discovered the fugal art of Johann Sebastian Bach (SX1w9) in the Vienna library of Baron Gottfried van Swieten &ndash; an encounter that fundamentally transformed his late work. He arranged Bach fugues for string trio, and the contrapuntal rigor he studied there flowed into works such as the finale of the "Jupiter Symphony" or the C minor Mass. The zeal of Sexual One met the stage presence of the self-preservation Two here &ndash; and both found common ground in the raw form of the fugue.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Tradition holds that the young Ludwig van Beethoven (SX6w5) played for Mozart in Vienna in 1787; whether Mozart's often-quoted remark that this young man would "give the world something to talk about" is historically verified remains disputed &ndash; the meeting itself is considered plausible. Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto in C minor, in any case, unmistakably follows the model of Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 24 in the same key, a quiet dialogue between wolf and hippopotamus across the era of Viennese Classicism. Franz Schubert (SE6w5), born in 1797, could never meet Mozart in person &ndash; he came into the world six years after Mozart's death. Yet his diaries testify to an almost religious veneration for Mozart's music, which he described as a comforting light in dark times. The rabbit found, in the departed hippopotamus, a solace that his own present often denied him.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Legacy: The Requiem and the Abundance of a Short Life</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Mozart died in 1791 at only 35, likely from the effects of rheumatic fever, and was buried in a Viennese shaft grave &ndash; the common practice of the time, not a consequence of poverty as the later myth claimed. His last work, the Requiem, remained unfinished and was completed after his death by his student Franz Xaver Süssmayr &ndash; commissioned by an anonymous count who wanted to perform it under his own name. Even in death, Mozart's work remained subject to someone else's staging.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In just 35 years of life, he left behind over 600 works &ndash; an abundance that shows the endurance and ambition of the SP2w3 in its purest, most tireless form. The hippopotamus with the Three-wing: caring to the point of its own exhaustion, proud of what it created, and endlessly driven by the question of whether the next work would once again prove its own worth. Posterity's answer came, as so often with this subtype, only after his death &ndash; but all the louder for it.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Rabbit That Built Itself a New Home</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>rabbit</strong> is the animal of the self-preservation Six &ndash; watchful, adaptable, searching for a reliable place where it can put down roots. Alberto Marini, born 1972 in Turin, moved to Barcelona in 1999 &ndash; and stayed. For over a quarter century, the Catalan city became his true creative home, the base from which he established himself as a screenwriter in Spanish genre cinema, far from his Italian origins.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">It is no accident that precisely the close, familiar territory became the central motif of his best-known work: an apartment building under quarantine, a flat someone sneaks into at night, a city that turns threatening the moment the familiar is no longer safe. The rabbit that knows exactly how fragile security can be, once it has been breached.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Self-Preservation Six: Warmth in Long-Standing Working Partnerships</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>self-preservation Six (SP6)</strong> is, according to Naranjo, the subtype he called <em>Warmth</em>: security arises not through outward control, but through reliable bonds built over years. In Marini's case, this pattern shows in his long-standing collaboration with director Jaume Balagueró: initially involved as co-producer on his horror film "[Rec]" (2007), he steadily grew into the role of screenwriter, writing the acclaimed script for "Mientras duermes" (Sleep Tight) in 2011, again under Balagueró's direction.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">No short-lived collaboration, but a trust relationship grown over years, out of which Marini gradually earned greater creative responsibility &ndash; from producer to sole screenwriter, up to his own directorial debut with the horror film "Summer Camp" (2015). Security through proven closeness rather than the spectacular solo leap.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Five-Wing: Precise Construction Instead of Intuitive Improvisation</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Five-wing (w5)</strong> gives the self-preservation Six an analytical, constructive coolness that, in Marini, shows in the purely craft-based architecture of his screenplays. His award-winning script for "Mientras duermes" (Best Screenplay at the 2012 Gaudí Awards) does not work through spontaneous shocks, but through meticulously constructed tension: a building caretaker who systematically, step by step, undermines the familiar, safe home of his tenants from within.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">His script for "El Desconocido" (Retribution, 2015), which earned him a Goya nomination for Best Original Screenplay, follows the same principle: a tightly constructed, real-time threat in which every rule of the game is fixed from the start. The Six that seeks security not in chaos but in precise, traceable construction &ndash; and then uses that very construction to trigger in the audience exactly the uncertainty it itself seeks to avoid. A classic psychological defense mechanism, projection, which appears especially pronounced in the self-preservation Six as the reinforcement type &ndash; the Six that carries its own fear, mostly unconsciously, outward in a particularly strong form.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. When the Familiar Becomes the Threat: The Recurring Motif</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Early on, with the screenplay for "Romasanta" (2004, based on the true story of a 19th-century Spanish serial killer), Marini established a theme that runs through his entire body of work: fear that comes not from outside, but has already settled into one's own, supposedly safe surroundings. In "[Rec]" it is one's own apartment building that becomes a trap; in "Mientras duermes" it is the friendly caretaker one trusts.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This is precisely the shadow side of SP6 fear, translated into genre cinema: the worry that the very place where one feels safest was, in truth, never safe. Marini does not write about distant, exotic threats &ndash; he writes about danger breaking into the most familiar of places, again and again, from shifting angles.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Light and Shadow of the Self-Preservation Six</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SP6w5 shows in Marini's ability to turn his own, deeply understood fear of losing security into precisely constructed, internationally successful genre works &ndash; films that rely not on cheap shocks, but on the slow, inescapable erosion of the familiar.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The shadow of the Six's fateful pattern, <strong>doubt</strong>, shows in his choice of antagonists: almost without exception, figures who themselves act out of deep mistrust and a compulsive need for control &ndash; the caretaker in "Mientras duermes," who establishes his own, distorted security precisely by taking all security from others. A reversal that shows how close the drive for security and the compulsion for control can lie when they tip into the extreme.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. Legacy: The Rabbit That Dug Its Own Burrow</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">From co-producer to award-winning screenwriter to director of his own film &ndash; Marini's career unfolded not in leaps, but as a steady, well-secured build-up, each step resting on the last, each new responsibility taken on only once trust and experience carried it. For over a quarter century, Barcelona remained his fixed base throughout.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Like Fyodor Dostoevsky and Huang Yong Ping (both SP6w5, see <a href="javascript:void(0)" data-route="beruehmte-fjodor-dostojewski">portrait</a> and <a href="javascript:void(0)" data-route="beruehmte-huang-yong-ping">portrait</a>), Marini too found his security not in constant change, but in a persistent adherence to proven bonds and a self-chosen home. The rabbit that does not prove itself in the open field, but digs its own, safe burrow &ndash; and tells stories from there about exactly what happens when that burrow is no longer safe.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Goose That Held Formation in the Storm</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>goose</strong> is the animal of the social One — orderly, disciplined, with an unerring sense of how something ought to be done correctly, and ready to take responsibility within its own formation the moment it matters. Helmut Schmidt, born in 1918 in Hamburg, became a defining figure of postwar West German history in exactly such moments: as Hamburg's Interior Senator during the storm surge of February 1962, when he mobilized and coordinated roughly 40,000 helpers within a few hours — and, as he later admitted himself, "knowingly and willingly" violated the Basic Law by requesting Bundeswehr units without any legal basis, because the situation allowed no delay.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">From 1974 to 1982 he served as Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany — a term marked by economic crises, RAF terrorism, and pivotal security-policy decisions, during which he definitively earned his reputation as the unflappable crisis manager.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Social One: Reason Over Vision</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>social One (SO1)</strong> projects its inner standards of right and wrong outward and demands that the world function according to reason and order. Schmidt embodied this in its purest form: cool objectivity, a pronounced aversion to anything he considered flowery or visionary, an almost proverbial directness. His most famous remark — one he later called a "pampig answer to a dusselig question" — sums up this stance precisely: "Whoever has visions should go see a doctor."</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Behind it lies the core of One's morality: what matters is not the grand and rhapsodic, but the correctly reasoned, the verifiably right. Schmidt, an economics expert and co-founder of the European Monetary System as well as the world economic summits from 1975 onward, took pride in solving problems with reason rather than gut feeling — a stance that earned him the international reputation of the "world economist."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Nine-Wing: Unshakeable Calm in the Storm</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Nine-wing (w9)</strong> lends the One a remarkable outer calm — the moral seriousness remains, but it expresses itself not as loud self-righteousness, but as unruffled, almost phlegmatic steadiness under pressure. Schmidt described exactly this combination himself, recalling two moments of his political career that demanded, in his own words, "extreme situations, quick decisions," with no "law or other guidelines" to fall back on — the 1962 storm surge and the German Autumn of 1977.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In the fall of 1977, after RAF terrorists kidnapped employer-association president Hanns Martin Schleyer, Schmidt held firm: he refused to exchange imprisoned RAF leaders and declared that the state had to respond "with the necessary toughness." When RAF sympathizers soon after hijacked the Lufthansa jet "Landshut" to Mogadishu to force the same exchange, Schmidt ordered the GSG 9 to storm the plane — successfully, rescuing all 86 hostages. Schleyer himself was murdered by his kidnappers. This decision — to hold his line under enormous emotional pressure without ever becoming loud or theatrical — is the Nine-wing signature of the SO1 in its purest form: firmness without drama.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Chain-Smoking Chancellor: Bluntness as a Trademark</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Schmidt's public image was inseparable from his near-constant cigarette habit — menthol cigarettes, even during television interviews and Bundestag debates. A quote that sums up his unshaken sense of priorities goes, roughly: "You need willpower — and cigarettes." This publicly displayed consistency toward his own habit, unmoved by medical advice or public criticism, fits the One's typical conviction of knowing best, oneself, what is right.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Outside the Chancellery, too, he remained true to this role: as co-publisher of the weekly newspaper "Die Zeit" and a sought-after elder statesman, he commented on world politics and economics well into old age with the same cool, often blunt directness that had already defined his chancellorship — a role that secured him social authority far beyond his former office, entirely in keeping with the One's social orientation: significance through recognized moral-intellectual authority, not through withdrawal.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Light and Shadow</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SO1w9 is the ability to <strong>act calmly, consistently, and without self-dramatization in extreme crises</strong> — Schmidt's handling of the storm surge and the German Autumn is still regarded across party lines as a model of composed leadership under pressure, precisely because he never slipped into theatrics or self-display.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The shadow showed itself in a certain inflexibility and a pronounced aversion to anything he considered starry-eyed or unrealistic — the visions remark, which he himself later regretted, shows how quickly the One's correctness can tip into reflexive, sometimes unfair harshness toward other ways of thinking. The 1979 NATO Double-Track Decision, which he pushed through decisively, deeply divided his own party and his country — in the unhealthy One, consistency and self-righteousness sit close together.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Goose That Never Broke Formation</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Helmut Schmidt died in 2015 at the age of 96 in Hamburg. What began as crisis leadership during a storm surge became one of the most defining chancellorships in postwar German history — carried by the conviction that reason, discipline, and sober duty are worth more than grand visions.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The goose that held formation in its hardest hours without ever faltering itself, and that remained a sought-after moral authority well into old age — that is the lasting image of the social One with a Nine-wing: firmness that never needed to raise its voice to be effective.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The beaver that never stopped building</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>beaver</strong> is the animal of the social Type 7 – Naranjo's counter-type of the Seven: restless building in service of the community, never truly finished, never in the name of one's own enjoyment. Rupert Spira began his career as a celebrated ceramic artist, with works held in major collections such as London's Victoria and Albert Museum – before devoting himself entirely to teaching non-dual wisdom (Advaita Vedanta).</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">For decades he has held retreats, written books, led dialogues, and released videos – a body of work never considered finished, but constantly continuing into new formats and formulations, hardly has one question been exhaustively addressed.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The social Seven: service to something greater than oneself</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>social Seven (SO7)</strong> doesn't build for its own glory, but in service of an idea or community greater than itself. In Spira this shows in the complete break with an already successful ceramics career in favor of a teaching path that offered no guarantee of comparable success – a decision made solely to pass on an understanding he had recognized as essential.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">He shares this with Jeanne-Marie Guyon (SO7w6), whom the life-pattern compass describes as someone who "devoted her entire life to a single structure" – "no territory, no power, no personal fame, but service to a spiritual idea." Spira's decades of tireless teaching around the world shows the same pattern: continuous building on a spiritual work that reaches beyond his own biography.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Six-wing: rootedness in a tested tradition</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Six-wing</strong> gives the social Seven an additional note of loyalty and a need to anchor one's own work in a reliable, tested lineage rather than improvising freely. In Spira this shows in his years of training under the Advaita teacher Francis Lucille and in his explicit placement within the Kashmir Shaivism and Advaita Vedanta traditions, rather than inventing an entirely independent, traditionless teaching.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This loyalty to a lineage, combined with restless ongoing building of his own, shows the Six-wing at its most constructive: security through rootedness, not through standstill.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. Complete inner clarity before it is passed on</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Spira's teaching method is marked by an unusually precise, step-by-step working through of concepts – before an idea is passed on to listeners, he has visibly already worked through it completely within himself. This approach matches the pattern the compass describes for Dieter Nuhr (SO7w8): "The beaver that examines every stone closely before placing it."</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">His public dialogues, in which he patiently addresses audience questions without ever becoming impatient or evasive, show the same care: no improvised dazzle, but an already thought-through understanding that unfolds anew, but consistently, in every answer.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Light and shadow</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SO7w6 shows in Spira's ability to keep developing a complex philosophical field consistently and without apparent fatigue across decades – a body of work that grows another facet with every new book, every new retreat, without repeating itself.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The shadow of the social Seven shows where the restless ongoing building itself becomes a compulsion – where pausing, deliberate stillness, becomes harder than starting the next project, even though the very message Spira teaches emphasizes exactly this pausing at its core.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The craftsman who moved from clay to consciousness</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Rupert Spira's path shows the social Seven with a Six-wing in one of its quietest, yet most persistent forms: no loud appearance, but decades of careful building on a spiritual body of work that stays loyal to a tested tradition and yet never stops developing further. The beaver changes its building material – from clay to word – but never the building itself.</p>

        <p class="krim-portrait-typ">SX9w1 &middot; Sexual Type 9 with One-wing</p>
        <p class="krim-portrait-subtitle">Musician, born 1962 &ndash; singer and founder of Bon Jovi &ndash; Animal correspondence: Sloth</p>
      </div>
      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Sloth That Stayed With One Bond</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>sloth</strong> is the animal of the sexual Nine &ndash; an animal that does not spread itself across many contacts, but merges completely with one carrying bond. John Francis Bongiovi Jr., born 1962 in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, met his future wife Dorothea Hurley in 1980 as a student at Sayreville War Memorial High School. After years of an on-and-off relationship, the two eloped in 1989 at a Las Vegas wedding chapel &ndash; and remain married to this day, more than 35 years later.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The same capacity for merging shows in his band: Bon Jovi was formed in 1983 and has stayed together at its core ever since &ndash; one of the rare rock bands that essentially remained intact across four decades instead of dissolving into shifting lineups.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Sexual Nine: Everyone Belongs</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Sexual Nine (SX9)</strong>, per Naranjo, seeks fulfillment through complete merging &ndash; with one person, but also with a community in which no one is excluded. Since 2006, Bon Jovi has run charitable "Soul Kitchen" restaurants in New Jersey through the Jon Bon Jovi Soul Foundation, operating on a "Pay It Forward" model: those who can pay contribute a free-will amount or help out; those who cannot pay still eat &ndash; with no distinction made at the table about who belongs to which group.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This is exactly the SX9 logic in its most charitable form: there is no split between "those who belong" and "those who don't" &ndash; everyone sits at the same table. More than 275,000 meals have been served this way so far, alongside support for nearly 1,000 housing units for homeless and at-risk people across twelve US states.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The One-wing: Discipline When the Voice Fails</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>One-wing</strong> gives the sexual Nine a hidden rigor that shows especially in moments of crisis. After disappointing, visibly shaky performances on the 2022 US tour, doctors diagnosed progressive atrophy of one vocal cord &ndash; a potentially career-ending problem for a singer. Instead of giving up, Bon Jovi underwent an elaborate, still relatively new procedure (medialization thyroplasty), in which an implant supports the weakened vocal cord from the outside.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">His own description of that period as "heartbreaking" shows how seriously he took the looming loss of his voice &ndash; yet instead of withdrawing, he worked disciplinedly toward a comeback: in 2026 he announced the international "The Forever Tour" with the band. This combination of quiet merging with his own band and audience, and the tenacious, unassuming discipline needed to come back, is typical SX9w1.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Work: From New Jersey Kid to Stadium Institution</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Even as a teenager, Bon Jovi performed with a ten-piece cover band called Atlantic City Expressway, playing songs by fellow New Jersey artist Bruce Springsteen. With the 1986 album ›Slippery When Wet‹, the definitive breakthrough came &ndash; more than 28 million copies sold from that album alone, over 130 million albums sold across the full career.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">What remained through all the decades was less the individual hit single than the reliability of connection: the same band, the same wife, the same New Jersey he never really left &ndash; not even once he stood on the biggest stages in the world.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Light and Shadow of the Sexual Nine with One-wing</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SX9w1 shows in Bon Jovi in the ability to sustain decades-long bonds &ndash; to his wife, to his band, to his home region &ndash; without any sign of strain or forced effort, while a deep sense of social responsibility keeps growing that excludes no one.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The shadow of the Nine lies in the danger of forgetting one's own needs behind the bond to others &ndash; visible also in how long Bon Jovi stayed publicly silent or hesitated before facing his own vocal vulnerability and truly acting. The One-wing eventually helped turn quiet endurance into a concrete, disciplined solution.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Singer Who Stays at the Same Table</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Jon Bon Jovi's path shows the sexual Nine with One-wing in a particularly long-lasting form: a marriage, a band, and charitable work all resting on the same principle &ndash; merging instead of separation, belonging instead of exclusion. The sloth doesn't move much, but when its voice is at risk, it fights disciplinedly to keep it.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Dove That Has Worked Beside the Same Person for Twenty Years</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>dove</strong> doesn't need a big stage to stay loyal – it finds a reliable companion and holds on, for decades. Barney Fishwick has known his creative partner Will Hislop for over twenty years; together they form the sketch duo GIANTS, which drew attention with three sold-out Edinburgh Fringe shows and a Writers' Guild Award nomination for the short film "A Hard Brexit."</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Rather than settling on a single stage or a single format, Fishwick quietly spread his work across radio, television, and film over the years – a body of work that grows more through steady continuity than through spectacular individual moments.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. Self-Preservation Four: The Unassuming Role Instead of the Big Gesture</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">According to Naranjo, the <strong>Self-Preservation Four (SE4)</strong> is the countertype of the Four: one's inner life is not put on display, but processed through persistent, often unspectacular work. In Fishwick, this shows in the choice of his best-known film role: rather than a dramatic lead, he plays the deliberately understated, coolly distant son Michael opposite Bill Nighy in "Living" – a role that works through restraint, not through showing off.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">His career as a whole follows the same pattern: no single, loud breakthrough, but a series of smaller, carefully chosen appearances spread across years – "Showtrial," "House of the Dragon," "Big Boys," "The Buccaneers" – which only add up to a visible profile in sum.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Five Wing: The Craft Behind the Stage</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Five Wing</strong> gives the Self-Preservation Four an intellectual, exploratory note – processing happens not only through feeling, but through the precise, structured working-through of material. Fishwick studied at Oxford and works continuously as a writer alongside acting: for BBC radio formats such as "The Now Show" and "Newsjack," and for the original radio comedies "BBC Radio Fjörd" and "Godsquad" – the latter nominated for a BBC Audio Drama Award.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Writing for radio and audio drama demands exactly the quiet, precise, out-of-sight detail work the Five Wing favors – a craft that takes shape alone at the desk, long before any public performance.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Work: Between Stage, Radio, and Screen</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">From the Edinburgh Fringe successes with GIANTS through the BBC radio comedies to film roles alongside Bill Nighy and in series such as "House of the Dragon," a continuous line runs through Fishwick's career: he moves between writing and performing, between comedy and drama, without confining himself to a single format – always with the same unhurried care.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Light and Shadow of the Self-Preservation Four with a Five Wing</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SE4w5 shows in Fishwick's ability to shape a varied yet coherent body of work out of years of quiet detail work – taken as seriously as a writer as he is as a performer, without one side overshadowing the other.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The shadow of the Four shows in the tendency to hide one's own profile behind a multitude of smaller projects instead of deliberately making it visible. The Five Wing can reinforce this restraint when working out a piece of material precisely becomes a retreat from the stage itself.</p>

        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>dove</strong> is the animal of the self-preservation Four – a bird that finds its way home even when it never consciously learned the route. Brian Leseney Fennell was born in 1983 in Issaquah, Washington, to teenage Welsh immigrant parents, and given up for adoption shortly after birth. As a child he already received classical piano training and performed at his grandmother's retirement home – an early, quiet outlet for feelings that had no other form of expression yet.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">At eighteen, after the death of a schoolmate, he began composing – not as a training step, but as a way of coping. The dove returns to its origin even when it never knew it: his stage name SYML is the Welsh word for "simple" – a deliberate nod to the heritage that was taken from him at birth.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Self-Preservation Four: Pain Processed Quietly</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>self-preservation Four (SE4)</strong> doesn't display the Four's characteristic longing for what is missing, but processes it quietly, often in a disciplined, craft-like form – Naranjo called this subtype the "stoic" or "brave" variant of the Four: suffering isn't put on display, it's transformed into a daily, disciplined practice. Fennell studied music education with an emphasis on percussion at Seattle Pacific University – a methodical, craft-based approach to a deeply emotional field.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In 2021 his adoptive father died of cancer. Instead of suppressing the loss, Fennell made it the center of his work: the EP "Dim" (Welsh for "nothing") and later the album "The Day My Father Died" (2023) grew directly out of this grief. "The word dim perfectly describes mourning," he said – a theme he has kept returning to ever since, not dramatically, but as a recurring, quiet reworking of the same pain.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Three Wing: From Band Member to Own, Visible Brand</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Three wing (w3)</strong> gives the self-preservation Four the ability to shape inner pain into a presentable, publicly successful body of work. In 2005 Fennell co-founded the band Barcelona, which signed with Universal in 2008 – but instead of dissolving into the group identity, he later left it to continue solo under his own, deliberately chosen name, SYML.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The bet paid off: his song "Where's My Love" became a hit after placement on the series "Teen Wolf" in 2017, going 2× Platinum in the US, 2× Platinum in Australia, and reaching #1 in Canada twice. A deeply private, melancholic composition became a measurable, worldwide success – the Four supplies the feeling, the Three wing makes sure it gets heard.</p>

        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The passion of the Four is called <strong>envy</strong> – for the SE4w3 not as malice, but as a constant wrestling with what others seem to be granted effortlessly: a known origin, an unbroken family, a taken-for-granted sense of belonging. Fennell's entire body of work circles around exactly these themes – adoption, heritage, loss – revisited again and again, never finally resolved.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In 2023, Lana Del Rey sampled his instrumental composition "I Wanted to Leave" for her song "Paris, Texas" – a late, public confirmation that this quiet, self-sufficient musical language is also recognized as significant from the outside, without him ever having sought to attach himself to a larger pop-star apparatus.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Light and Shadow of the Self-Preservation Four</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SE4w3 shows in how a deeply personal, even existential subject – his own adoption, the loss of his father – becomes a body of work reaching millions of people without losing its sincerity. In 2025 Fennell released "Nobody Lives Here," already his third studio album – continuous, disciplined creative output rather than a single outburst.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The shadow lies in the risk of getting stuck in exactly this one subject: grief, loss, and origin run through nearly his entire body of work – a rich, honest well, but one that also shows how easily the SE4 can stay bound to its own pain, precisely because it keeps setting that pain to music again and again instead of ever finally leaving it behind.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Legacy: The Quiet Dove That Was Heard Anyway</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Brian Fennell lives with his wife Marion and their three children near Seattle, working from a home studio – a deliberately small, protected setting for a body of work heard internationally. Like <a href="#beruehmte-michael-david-rosenberg">Michael David Rosenberg, aka Passenger (SE4w3)</a>, Fennell also shows how the self-preservation Four with a Three wing can shape quiet, often sorrowful introspection into measurable, worldwide success without losing its own vulnerability.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">His stage name remains the most fitting self-portrait: "simple" – not a grand stage persona, but a dove that, despite its quiet nature, found its way to a global audience.</p>
