        <p class="krim-portrait-name">Dr. Albert Schweitzer</p>
        <p class="krim-portrait-typ">SO2w1 &middot; Social Type 2 with One-wing</p>
        <p class="krim-portrait-subtitle">Theologian, philosopher, organist &amp; jungle doctor, 1875&ndash;1965 &ndash; Nobel Peace Prize laureate 1952 &ndash; Animal correspondence: Golden Retriever</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Golden Retriever</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>golden retriever</strong> is the animal of the social Two &ndash; a being that puts its full strength into the service of others without becoming smaller in the process. By his early thirties, Albert Schweitzer was already a celebrated theologian, philosopher, and one of the foremost Bach organists of his time &ndash; a man for whom every academic and artistic door stood open. And it was exactly at this point of greatest success that he made the decision that would change his life forever.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In 1905, at age 30, he began studying medicine &ndash; not to expand his career, but to go to Africa as a doctor. The golden retriever does not bark for attention. It sees where there is need, and goes there, even if it means leaving behind everything it has already achieved.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. Social Two: Ambition in Service of Humanity</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>social Two (SO2)</strong> directs its energy not into individual, personal relationships, but into social effectiveness. Naranjo called this subtype <em>Ambition</em>: not ambition for its own sake, but the drive to help as many people as possible through influence and ability. Schweitzer embodied this pattern to a degree that is extraordinary even for SO2.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In 1913 he founded a hospital in Lambaréné, in present-day Gabon, for the poorest population of Central Africa &ndash; financed initially out of his own pocket and through organ concerts he gave on extended tours across Europe. Over five decades, until his death in 1965, he returned there again and again, treated patients with leprosy and sleeping sickness, and steadily expanded the hospital. Social Two does not merely want to help one person &ndash; it wants to build an institution that outlasts its own lifetime.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The One-Wing: Reverence for Life</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>One-wing (w1)</strong> gives the social Two an inner axis: an awareness of right and wrong, the will to think a principle through to the end and then to live by it. Schweitzer formulated this principle himself, in a moment he later described as a sudden insight during a boat trip on the Ogooué River: <em>Reverence for Life</em> &ndash; the ethical obligation to treat all life, human or not, with respect.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This stance was no abstract ideal but lived discipline: Schweitzer worked daily at the hospital well into old age, held to strict ethical standards, and did not let criticism or social pressure divert him from his path. The One does not let go once a principle is at stake &ndash; and in Schweitzer, that principle became an entire life's work.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. Light and Shadow of Social Two</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of SO2w1 is its ability to place extraordinary personal talent entirely in service of a greater purpose. In 1952 Schweitzer received the Nobel Peace Prize, whose prize money he invested in expanding his hospital and a leprosarium. In his final years he also spoke out publicly against nuclear armament, among other things with his widely noted radio address <em>Declaration of Conscience</em> (1957).</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The passion of the Two is <strong>pride</strong> &ndash; the need to be indispensable. In SO2w1 this also shows as the danger of no longer questioning one's own view of what is good for others. Historians and postcolonial critics have since described Schweitzer's leadership style in Lambaréné as paternalistic: for a long time he rejected modern administrative structures and greater involvement of African physicians in running the hospital, holding instead to a patriarchal, Europe-shaped model of care that increasingly lagged behind its time.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. The Legacy: The Retriever That Never Stopped Giving</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Albert Schweitzer died in 1965 in Lambaréné, in the very hospital he had founded more than fifty years earlier, and was buried there. His wife Helene Bresslau, a trained nurse, had carried a large part of that path at his side.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The golden retriever with the One-wing did not give in order to be needed &ndash; he gave because he was convinced that reverence for life could not remain a theory. Despite all justified criticism of his leadership style, his legacy remains one of the most striking examples of how extraordinary talent and success can be fully subordinated to a humanitarian task &ndash; a life in which ambition and ethics became a single movement.</p>

        <p class="krim-portrait-name">Anthony Hopkins</p>
        <p class="krim-portrait-typ">SP1w9 &middot; Self-Preservation Type 1 with Nine-wing</p>
        <p class="krim-portrait-subtitle">Actor, born 1937 in Port Talbot, Wales &ndash; Animal correspondence: Eagle</p>
      </div>
      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Eagle</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Eagle</strong> is the animal of the self-preservation One &ndash; an animal that wastes no movement. It observes at length from stillness before it acts, and when it strikes, it needs no second chance. Power without noise. Precision without any visible strain.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The Welsh actor Anthony Hopkins won the Academy Award for Best Actor for playing Hannibal Lecter in <em>The Silence of the Lambs</em> (1991) with barely sixteen minutes of screen time &ndash; one of the shortest performances ever honored with that award. This was not chance, but pure economy: every gesture, every glance, every pause was placed with such precision that the threat built not through volume but through complete stillness. The Eagle need not scream to be feared.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Self-Preservation One: Precision as Self-Obligation</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>self-preservation One (SP1)</strong> directs its perfectionism not toward correcting the world, but inward: toward its own craft, its own preparation, an incorruptible precision toward itself. Naranjo called this subtype <em>Worry</em> &ndash; concern. The SP1 asks itself relentlessly: Have I truly understood this? Am I fully prepared?</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In Hopkins this question has become method. He is known for reading each script between a hundred and several hundred times, until the text sits completely by heart &ndash; not roughly, but word for word, inflection for inflection, long before filming even begins. For his Oscar-winning role in <em>The Father</em> (2020), he is said to have read the script over 200 times. This is not a quirk. It is the SP1 refusing to step in front of the camera with anything less than complete mastery.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Nine-Wing: Stillness as Home</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Nine-wing (w9)</strong> adds a quality to the SP1 energy that seems at odds, at a glance, with such intense screen presence: withdrawal, silence, the need to merge with something larger rather than placing oneself in the foreground.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Hopkins is known as notoriously reclusive &ndash; no friend of premiere small talk, no interest in society appearances. He prefers to spend his time painting, composing at the piano, and taking long, meditative walks. In 1975 he became sober after a severe alcohol dependency had nearly destroyed his life &ndash; since then he has lived abstinent with the same discipline he brings to preparing his roles. The Nine-wing does not seek the stage for itself. It seeks the stillness from which the actual work first becomes possible.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Work: Two Oscars, Six Decades on Stage</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Nearly thirty years separate his first Oscar for Hannibal Lecter (1992) from his second for playing a father with dementia in <em>The Father</em> (2021) &ndash; at 83, Hopkins became the oldest winner in the Best Actor category in Oscar history. In between: <em>The Remains of the Day</em>, <em>Legends of the Fall</em>, countless stage roles at the Royal National Theatre, a career that never rested on a single icon.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Besides acting, Hopkins seriously composes classical music and paints &ndash; both with the same quiet discipline he brings to memorizing scripts. The Eagle circles over several territories at once, without any of them becoming a mere sideline.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Light and Shadow of the Self-Preservation One</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SP1w9 is a rare combination of absolute craft precision and inner serenity &ndash; an artist who never steps improvised in front of the camera, yet never strains for attention either. Hopkins's decades of sobriety, achieved and maintained with the same discipline as his role preparation, show the mature form of this pattern.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The shadow shows in the distance the Nine-wing favors. The fate pattern of the One is <strong>anger</strong>, which in the SP1 usually turns inward &ndash; yet withdrawal can also wound outwardly. Hopkins's relationship with his daughter Abigail from his first marriage was marked by deep estrangement for decades; in interviews he has himself acknowledged being a distant, difficult father in his younger years. The Eagle that tends its own territory with the greatest care can overlook who is waiting for it beyond that territory.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Path of Healing: From Control to Surrender</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The healing path of the One leads from anger to serenity &ndash; from the question <em>Do I have everything under control?</em> to the recognition <em>I may let go, even when not everything is perfect.</em> For the SP1w9 this path shows especially in the capacity to no longer need one's own discipline as a shield, but to experience it as a calm, supporting foundation.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In later interviews Hopkins speaks with increasing serenity about age, impermanence, and his own mortality &ndash; without the sharpness of self-criticism from earlier decades. The Eagle that no longer needs to prove it is the best. It has long known this, and no longer needs to show it to anyone.</p>

        <p class="krim-portrait-subtitle">Jamaican musician &amp; founder of reggae's global fame, 1945&ndash;1981 &ndash; Animal correspondence: Golden Retriever</p>
      </div>
      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Golden Retriever</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Golden Retriever</strong> is the animal of the social Two &ndash; an animal that warms every room it enters and puts its strength in the service of the whole community. Few people have made this energy felt as globally as Bob Marley: a man who came from the poorest circumstances in Jamaica, whose music is now heard on every continent as a message of connection.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Robert Nesta Marley was born on February 6, 1945, in the village of Nine Mile, Jamaica, the son of a white British naval officer who soon left the family and a young Jamaican mother. He grew up poor, first in the countryside and later in the Trenchtown ghetto of Kingston &ndash; a place that shaped him for life and that he never denied, even once he had become a world star.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Social Two: Care for an Entire People, Not Individuals</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>social Two (SO2)</strong> directs its care not at individual relationships but at societal impact. Naranjo called this subtype <em>Ambition</em>: the drive to care for an entire group through influence and presence. Marley's music was aimed at exactly that from the start: songs like <em>Get Up, Stand Up</em>, <em>War</em>, or <em>Redemption Song</em> speak not to one person but to the oppressed as a whole &ndash; to Jamaica's Black population, to the poor, to everyone who felt unheard.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This trait showed most clearly in April 1978 at the <em>One Love Peace Concert</em> in Kingston: in the middle of the song <em>Jamming</em>, Marley called the two feuding political rivals Michael Manley and Edward Seaga onto the stage and held their hands together above his head &ndash; an image that went around the world. <em>I just want to show that we've got to unite</em>, he said. Not a private gesture, but an attempt to reconcile an entire country torn apart by gang warfare.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The One-Wing: Rastafari as Moral Certainty</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>One-wing (w1)</strong> gives the social Two an inner axis of conviction and a need to act in accordance with a higher order, instead of losing itself in the mere pursuit of approval. In Marley, this showed in 1966, when he converted to the Rastafari faith &ndash; a movement grounded in the Bible, fighting against the oppression of Black people and hoping for a spiritual return to Africa. From then on, his music was no longer mere entertainment but the proclamation of a moral truth he would not compromise on.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This uncompromising quality also showed when, in December 1976, armed men broke into his home two days before the government-organized <em>Smile Jamaica</em> concert and shot at him, his wife Rita, and several associates. Marley was hit in the arm and narrowly survived &ndash; yet performed two days later anyway, with the bullet still in his arm. The One-wing did not let him deviate from his chosen path, even under mortal danger.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. Rise: From Trenchtown to the World Stage</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">With the Wailers, founded together with Bunny Wailer and Peter Tosh, Marley carried reggae out of Jamaica and into the whole world during the 1970s. Albums like <em>Catch a Fire</em>, <em>Exodus</em>, and <em>Uprising</em> made him the first global superstar to emerge from what was then called the Third World &ndash; a rise that never detached itself from his roots in Trenchtown, but repeatedly made them an explicit subject.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Magazines later named <em>Exodus</em> the most significant album of the 20th century. Yet Marley continued to treat his music as a tool for a larger cause, not an end in itself: for him, fame was the reach that let him touch more people &ndash; the SO2w1 in its clearest form, influence in service of a conviction, not in service of the self.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Light and Shadow of the Social Two</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SO2w1 is the ability to build bridges out of deep moral conviction, where others see only opposing camps. That a single musician could unite two bitter political enemies on the same stage, if only for a moment, in the middle of Jamaica's gang war, shows this power at its most striking &ndash; not forced through power, but through a message no one in that moment wanted to resist.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The fate pattern of the Two is <strong>pride</strong> &ndash; the conviction of being indispensable for the wellbeing of others. Combined with the One-wing, this can become a certainty of being morally right that subordinates even one's own life: Marley ignored health warning signs for years, including a malignant melanoma discovered on his toe in 1977, whose urgently recommended amputation he refused on religious grounds. He kept touring until the cancer had spread, and died on May 11, 1981, at only 36 years of age &ndash; the same absoluteness that made him a moral authority also led him to subordinate his own illness to a higher calling.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Path to Healing: Care That Includes Oneself</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The Two's path to healing leads from the question <em>What can I do for others?</em> to the question <em>What am I, when I am not needed?</em> For the SO2w1, this means above all not placing one's own moral certainty above one's own physical limits &ndash; and recognizing that care for an entire people must, in the end, also include care for one's own body, or it cannot be sustained.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Bob Marley's legacy shows how far this path can reach, even though he himself could not walk it to the end: songs like <em>One Love</em> and <em>Redemption Song</em> are still sung worldwide today as anthems of connection, far beyond Jamaica and reggae. The Golden Retriever who devoted his entire, short life to the message that people have more in common than what divides them &ndash; and who, in doing so, left a warmth that has far outlasted his own death.</p>

Naranjo called this subtype Solidarity: The SO8 identifies with the weaker, with those who have no lobby – and stands in front of them. It does not fight for itself. It fights because it cannot do otherwise when injustice occurs.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Stahl lives this principle visibly. His anti-bullying work in schools is no marketing – it is a calling. He enters classrooms, listens, stands in front of those who are bullied, and tells the perpetrators directly to their faces what they are doing. No brochure, no prevention table, no managed sympathy – but presence, body, clarity. That is the SO8: Instead of talking about injustice, you place yourself in front of it.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Seven wing: Fire in the Message</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The Seven wing gives the social Eight a quality that complements an SO8 with a weaker Seven wing: agility, capacity for enthusiasm, a talent for sweeping people along. The SO8w9 protects out of silence. The SO8w7 protects with fire.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Stahl is no quiet protector. He is direct, loud, present – he uses his body, his voice, his social media channels to convey a message that knows no shades of gray: Bullying is wrong. Period. The Seven wing gives him the energy to say this again and again – in front of first-graders and vocational students, in book interviews and video clips – and never appearing tired while doing so.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Work: Schools, Stages, Books</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Carsten Stahl has visited hundreds of schools in Germany and worked directly there with students, perpetrators, and victims. His approach is physical and emotional at the same time: He shows that strength is no argument for injustice – but the opposite. His book Halt die Fresse! is a typical SO8w7 work: direct in tone, without sugarcoating, addressed to those who need it most.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Parallel to this, Stahl is active as a martial artist and public figure: appearances on television shows, social media presence, lectures. He understood what many activists overlook: A message that no one hears changes nothing. The Seven wing ensures that the message arrives.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Light and Shadow: When Directness Polarizes</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SO8w7 is its immediate impact. Stahl reaches teenagers who do not listen to educators – because he does not sound like an educator. He is authentic, direct, physically present. The SO8 makes no difference between what it feels and what it says. That is rare – and precisely why it is believable.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The shadow: Directness also generates resistance. Anyone operating as clearly and loudly as an SO8w7 makes themselves vulnerable to attack. And the Eight tends to escalate in attack instead of stepping back. The risk: The message gets lost in the fight over the messenger. The mature SO8w7 knows that strength does not always have to become louder – sometimes it is enough to stay standing.</p>

        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Carsten Stahl chose an arena that most avoid: the middle of the problem. He does not go where it is comfortable. He goes where a 13-year-old no longer wants to go to school. That is the SO8w7: not the lion sitting on the rock observing – but the one who runs into the pride when it is on fire. Strength that gives itself away. Fire that warms others.</p>

      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Sloth</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The sloth is the animal of the sexual type 9 and anyone who observes Dakota Johnson in an interview immediately understands the image. The sloth hangs. It blinks. It seems as if it were interested in nothing and no one. And yet it is fully present with claws that you only see when you get too close.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The American actress Dakota Johnson, born in 1989 in Austin, Texas, is the granddaughter of Tippi Hedren, daughter of Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson Hollywood blood in the third generation. She could have comfortably continued the dynasty. Instead, she chose something that is harder to describe: a kind of presence that does not impose itself. An intensity that hides itself. A smile that is half invitation and half boundary.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The sexual Nine: Disappearing into the Other</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">According to Naranjo, the sexual Nine (SX9) is the subtype of union: the deepest longing for fusion with the beloved, the work, the moment. The SX9 is not searching for belonging (that would be the social Nine), but for dissolution the state in which the boundary between I and the other disappears. It finds itself not in the collective, but in an intense one-on-one relationship.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">It fits the pattern that Dakota Johnson's most famous role Anastasia Steele in the Fifty Shades trilogy (2015–2018) carries precisely this theme: a young woman who immerses herself deeply into an intense counterpart and in the process discovers who she really is. The role made Johnson world-famous. She disliked talking about it. For the SX9, what truly touches it deeply is hard to put into words and thus barely accessible to the public.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Eight wing: The Claws of the Sloth</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The Eight wing gives the sexual Nine something that remains beneath the surface in an SX9 with a weaker Eight wing: a readiness for confrontation, a directness that becomes unexpectedly sharp at the right moment. The SX9w8 seems soft until it no longer seems soft.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In 2016, Johnson's appearance on the Ellen DeGeneres Show became a viral moment. When Ellen mentioned that she had of course been at Dakota's last birthday party, Johnson answered completely unmoved: You were not invited. No apology. No rowing back. Just the fact. The audience laughed in confusion, Ellen filled the silence, and Dakota sat there as if nothing had happened. That is the Eight wing: not aggressive, not dramatic simply fearless in what is true.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Work: Intensity Without Shining</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Dakota Johnson's filmography shows a pattern: She prefers roles that lead inward. In Suspiria (2018), she plays a dancer who completely surrenders herself to a coven of witches fusion as a theme, as a genre, as an achievement. In The Lost Daughter (2021), she embodies a young mother who is light and opaque at the same time, with an emotional depth that one feels rather than sees. In Cha Cha Real Smooth (2022), she gives an overwhelmed woman a silence that weighs heavier than any monologue.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">When Madame Web (2024) became a critical and commercial failure, Johnson's attitude remained telling: no defense, no public campaign, no visible pain. Anyone who brought it up to her in later interviews received answers that were polite, precise, and completely unfazed. The SX9w8 wastes no energy on what cannot be changed.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Light and Shadow: The Heritage and One's Own Voice</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SX9w8 is its ability for complete presence. Johnson brings an inner density to every scene that refuses conventional Hollywood shine. She does not play characters she becomes these characters. The Eight wing gives her a grounding that a Nine with a more muted Eight wing sometimes lacks: a refusal to dissolve, a boundary that remains visible even in the deepest fusion.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The shadow: The Nine loses itself in the other and when the other is the heritage of three generations of actors, the question of one's own voice is particularly complex. Johnson has spoken publicly about the pressure of growing up in an industry that has known her family for decades. Depression and anxiety were themes of her early career. The SX9 finds itself in the other and must learn to stay with itself even when the other is very loud.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Sloth That Bites</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Dakota Johnson is not a woman who fights for attention. Nor is she a woman who avoids attention. She exists in a middle state characteristic of the SX9w8: fully present, selectively accessible, with a humor dry enough to keep uninvited guests at a distance. Anyone who truly comes into contact with her says they have the feeling of encountering complete attention. Anyone who only skims the surface sees the sloth hanging.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The sloth possesses the strongest claws of all mammals in relation to body size. It climbs through treetops that no other animal reaches. And it does not fall. Not because it holds on tightly but because its tendons are built in such a way that it hangs without having to exert force. That is the SX9w8 at its best: effortless in the right element, with a hidden strength that one only notices when trying to remove it from there.</p>

        <p class="krim-portrait-typ">SX3w4 &middot; Sexual Type 3 with Four-wing</p>
        <p class="krim-portrait-subtitle">Singer, songwriter &amp; entrepreneur, 1946&ndash;2026, born in Locust Ridge, Tennessee &ndash; Animal correspondence: Peacock</p>
      </div>
      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Peacock</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Peacock</strong> is the animal of the Sexual Three &ndash; an animal that survives not despite its conspicuousness but because of it, whose impact comes from a self-assured, deliberately displayed presence. Few people have turned that principle into such an unmistakable personal brand as Dolly Parton: the oversized blonde wig, the rhinestone-studded stage costumes, the exaggerated hourglass silhouette &ndash; an image she herself sums up in one legendary line: "It costs a lot of money to look this cheap."</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The American singer and songwriter was born on January 19, 1946, in a one-room cabin in Locust Ridge, Tennessee &ndash; the fourth of twelve children in a dirt-poor family in the Great Smoky Mountains. As the model for her later self-presentation, she later named a woman from her childhood, dismissed by the village as "loose," whose garish appearance fascinated rather than repelled the young Dolly: "I thought she was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Sexual Three: Magnetism as a Deliberately Built Stage Persona</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Sexual Three (SX3)</strong> makes personal magnetism its life's task &ndash; not abstract success before the broader public, as with the Social Three, but immediate, physically charismatic presence. Naranjo called this subtype <em>Masculinity/Femininity</em>: the embodiment of attractiveness in its purest form. Parton's iconic look &ndash; silicone, wigs, body-hugging costumes, yards of eyelashes &ndash; is no accidental quirk but a deliberately built, decades-long-maintained persona, which she herself likes to describe as "a cheap-looking woman who can afford to look expensive."</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">As early as 1967, country singer Porter Wagoner brought the young Parton onto his nationally syndicated TV show &ndash; the start of a career that carried her, through solo albums, film roles, and her own television formats, to the top of country music. The SX3 attracts, and Parton understood early that this magnetism need not be confined to a single medium: music, film, television, a theme park &ndash; the same unmistakable presence everywhere.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Four-Wing: The Wound Behind the Glitter</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Four-wing (w4)</strong> gives the Sexual Three an emotional depth and narrative authenticity that goes far beyond surface effect &ndash; the stage persona stays tethered to a very personal, often painful inner world. That shows clearly in Parton's songwriting: "Coat of Many Colors" (1971) tells, unflinchingly, of the poverty of her childhood and the homemade patchwork coat she was mocked for as a schoolgirl. "Jolene" (1973) sings of the naked fear of losing a loved one to a more beautiful rival &ndash; a vulnerability that would otherwise have little room in the Three's glaring spotlight.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">"I Will Always Love You," too, written in 1973 as a farewell to her longtime mentor Porter Wagoner, owes its power to exactly this combination: a grand, public-facing gesture (later, through Whitney Houston's 1992 version, becoming the best-selling single by a solo artist) paired with a deeply personal, almost intimate emotion underneath. The Four-wing keeps asking: how do I turn what moves me inside into an image, or a song, that leaves no one unmoved?</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. Light and Shadow of the Sexual Three</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SX3w4 is the ability to build a multilayered, artistically serious life's work out of a decades-long, high-gloss stage persona &ndash; over 3,000 songs written, eleven Grammys, her own theme park (Dollywood, opened 1986 in her home region), and the Imagination Library, a foundation that has given away more than 200 million books to children worldwide free of charge since 1995.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The fate pattern of the Three is <strong>self-deceit</strong> &ndash; the conviction that one's own image is identical to one's own worth. In the SX3w4, this can become a constant need to present oneself ever more brilliantly, so as never to be seen again as the vulnerable, poor mountain girl of the past. What's remarkable about Parton, though, is how consciously she reflects on this mask herself: "I look like a cartoon character, but I know exactly who I am underneath it," she once said &ndash; a rare clarity about one's own pattern, rather than being blindly ruled by it.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. The Work: The Quiet Constant Behind the Glitter</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Dolly Parton's career reads as a continuous translation of personal magnetism into ever new stages: from rural radio show to country music icon, from singer to film actress (including "9 to 5," 1980, alongside its number-one hit title song), from songwriter to entrepreneur with her own theme park. Every stage stays tied to the same underlying ability &ndash; drawing attention and turning it into something lasting.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Striking beneath all the glittering surface is one remarkably stable constant: her marriage to businessman Carl Dean, whom she met in 1966 and married the same year &ndash; nearly sixty years during which Dean almost entirely avoided the public eye and was rarely ever photographed at her side, until his death in March 2025. The peacock's feathers on the outside, quiet seclusion at the very core: in scarcely any other SX3w4 does the contrast between glittering stage persona and fiercely protected private life show as clearly as it does in Dolly Parton.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro" style="margin-top:1rem;">Barely a year and a half after Dean's death, Dolly Parton herself died on August 25, 2026, in Nashville at age 80, following a brief battle with cancer according to those close to her. In her final years she had openly admitted to neglecting her own health while caring for her husband &ndash; one last, quiet SX3w4 pattern: keeping up full outward radiance, still performing, still shining in public, while the vulnerability behind the stage is admitted only reluctantly.</p>

        <p class="krim-portrait-typ">SX6w7 &middot; Sexual Six with Seven-wing</p>
        <p class="krim-portrait-subtitle">Actress &amp; entrepreneur, b. 1974 &ndash; Animal correspondence: Wolf</p>
      </div>
      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Wolf</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>wolf</strong> is the animal of the sexual Six – an animal that does not shy away from threat but confronts it head-on, and that finds its deepest safety not in distance, but in close bonding with its pack. Eva Mendes grew up as the youngest of five children of Cuban immigrants in a loud, emotionally intense household in Los Angeles. She later described herself as "a very anxious kid" – raised amid big emotions she learned early to read and manage.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Out of this early vigilance toward emotional unpredictability grew something that later looked like the exact opposite of fear: a confident, fearless public presence. The wolf that overcomes its own fear not through retreat, but through confrontation.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Sexual Six: Fear Turned into Strength</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Sexual Six (SX6)</strong> is, according to Naranjo, the counter-type of the Six – the subtype in which the passion of fear is least visible, because it is systematically inverted. Naranjo called this subtype <em>Strength/Beauty</em>: instead of hiding from threat, one meets it with a deliberately confident, often provocative presence. <em>If I present myself as strong and beautiful enough, fear cannot touch me.</em></p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This exact principle shaped Mendes's early career: the Calvin Klein campaigns of the 2000s and her status as one of Hollywood's most sought-after sex symbols were not merely a marketing strategy, but the public form of an inner pattern – insecurity overwritten by demonstrative strength and beauty, rather than resolved through withdrawal.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The pairing itself is worth a closer look: strength and beauty are not two separate strategies for the SX6, but often two sides of the same coin. Particularly for women who identify strongly with their own body, beauty is not lived as the opposite of strength but as its direct expression: presenting oneself as poised, flawless, and irresistible demonstrates just as much control over one's impact as an openly confrontational presence would. In Mendes, the two poles visibly merge – her campaign images read as powerful and self-possessed not despite their emphasis on beauty, but precisely because of it. Beauty becomes a weapon against fear here, not a distraction from it.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Telling is how she handles actual threat: when she sees photographers, she says herself, "my wall goes up." Asked about her relationship with Ryan Gosling in one interview, she refused to engage at all: "I'm shutting down." The SX6 protects what matters most not through closeness to the public, but through a clearly drawn, fiercely defended boundary.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Seven-Wing: Variety Instead of Standing Still</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Seven-wing (w7)</strong> gives the Sexual Six an additional mobility: the need not to commit to a single field, but to pursue several interests and projects at once. Rather than focusing exclusively on acting, Mendes built a portfolio over the years that included her own fashion lines, a skincare brand, home décor, and a cookbook.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In a 2015 Variety interview, she explained her step back from acting: "I got tired fighting for the good roles." Rather than remaining dependent on one narrow, uncertain field, she created several of her own, controllable pillars – the Six secures herself, and the Seven-wing ensures that this security stays varied and alive rather than narrow and rigid.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. Stepping Back for Family: Safety as the Highest Principle</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">In 2011, Mendes met actor Ryan Gosling (<a href="javascript:void(0)" data-route="beruehmte-ryan-gosling">SX2w3</a>) on the set of <em>The Place Beyond the Pines</em>. The relationship produced two daughters, born in 2014 and 2016. Mendes has stated openly that she will not post photos of her children until they are old enough to consent themselves – a deliberate, consistently upheld decision to protect her family.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This stance is pure SX6 logic: safety comes not from public validation, but from actively controlling who gets access to one's inner circle. Where the social or self-preservation Six tends to seek external reassurance, the sexual Six defends her pack with resolve – if necessary, even against the expectations of an entire media public.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Light and Shadow of the Sexual Six</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SX6w7 is the ability to <strong>shape, out of inner insecurity, a presence that others perceive as strength</strong> – Mendes turned a childhood anxiety into a career, an entrepreneurial portfolio, and a family structure that she herself controls and protects, rather than letting others determine it for her.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The fate pattern of the Six is <strong>fear</strong> – in the Sexual Six often overlaid by a demonstrative confidence that gives little hint of the actual insecurity underneath. Mendes has named this other side herself: on social media, she once openly asked her followers how they cope with strong emotions – a rare moment in which the wall briefly showed itself before closing again. To calm this inner unrest, she deliberately practices transcendental meditation, which she says gives her a sense of balance and inner peace.</p>

        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Eva Mendes's path from an anxious child of a Cuban immigrant family to an internationally celebrated sex symbol and versatile entrepreneur shows the Sexual Six with a Seven-wing in its most mature form: fear is not suppressed, but translated into strength, variety, and a deliberately protected family world.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The wolf does not withdraw from the world – it simply decides very carefully whom it lets into its pack. Together with Ryan Gosling (SX2w3), Mendes has built one of Hollywood's most notably private partnerships: two sexually oriented subtypes who devote their greatest intensity not to the public, but to each other and their children.</p>

        <p class="krim-portrait-subtitle">Psychiatrist, co-founder of Gestalt therapy, 1893&ndash;1970 &ndash; Animal correspondence: Lion</p>
      </div>
      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Lion Who Provoked From the Hot Seat</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>lion</strong> is the animal of Social Type 8 &ndash; a predator that does not hide its strength but displays it openly to shake a group awake. Few people embodied this as uncompromisingly as Fritz Perls: in his legendary group workshops, he placed participants in the notorious "hot seat" and confronted them directly, often bluntly, with their own avoidance strategies &ndash; in front of everyone present. Anyone who offered an excuse was not gently guided along but met immediately with their own defense mechanism.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The German psychiatrist Friedrich Salomon Perls was born in 1893 in Berlin, studied medicine and psychiatry, worked for a time with Kurt Goldstein, and trained in psychoanalysis under Wilhelm Reich and Karen Horney. In 1933, after the Nazi seizure of power, he fled Germany as a Jew, first to the Netherlands, then to South Africa, and finally to the United States. The lion does not abandon its territory without a fight &ndash; but once the danger becomes real, it does not defend the old order, it builds a new one.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. Social Eight: A New Therapeutic Community</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Naranjo called <strong>Social Eight (SO8)</strong> <em>Solidarity</em>: strength placed not in the service of one's own safety, but in building and protecting a community. In 1951, Perls published "Gestalt Therapy" together with Ralph Hefferline and Paul Goodman and shortly afterward founded the first Gestalt Institute in New York &ndash; a deliberate challenge to the established, and in his view too passive and too theory-heavy, Freudian psychoanalysis.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Perls did not see himself as a solitary theorist but as the leader of a movement: he gathered a circle of collaborators around him, coined his own therapeutic vocabulary (contact boundary, awareness, "here and now"), and later carried this movement to the Esalen Institute in Big Sur, California, where from 1964 to 1969 he became the figurehead of the entire human potential movement. Social Eight does not fight for itself alone &ndash; it builds the institution, the school, the community that others will carry forward.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Seven-Wing: A Hunger for Experience and Transgression</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Seven-wing (w7)</strong> gives Social Eight a restless, appetitive energy &ndash; the hunger to savor life at full intensity rather than withdraw from it. In Perls this showed in a lifestyle that left every bourgeois convention behind: openly lived sexuality, experiments with LSD, uninhibited conduct in workshops, constant travel between continents and clinics. At Esalen he lived for a time literally in a trailer at the edge of the cliff path &ndash; unattached, available for every new encounter, every new experiment.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">His public persona, too, was theater: Perls favored a sweeping white beard, provoked with biting wit and an almost actorly self-presentation, filmed his sessions for a wide audience, and became a brand in his own right. His best-known line &ndash; the "Gestalt Prayer" ("I do my thing, and you do your thing...") &ndash; expresses both a therapeutic stance and a Seven-like life philosophy: enjoyment, autonomy, no justification owed to outside expectations.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Passion: Lust as Confrontation With Avoidance</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The passion of the Eight is called <strong>lust</strong> &ndash; not a sexual but an existential hunger for unfiltered, full experience. In SO8w7, this hunger is directed at immediate contact: Perls could not tolerate people hiding behind explanations, interpretations, or intellectual evasions. His most famous formula &ndash; "lose your mind and come to your senses" &ndash; was a direct challenge to every form of avoidance.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This uncompromising stance came at a price: colleagues and former associates described him as egocentric, impatient with weakness, and at times harsh toward participants who could not withstand his direct confrontation. His private life, too, was marked by rupture &ndash; several divorces, a distant relationship with his children Renate and Stephen, a life in constant motion that left little room for lasting closeness.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Light and Shadow</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of SO8w7 shows in the liberating effect of Perls's method: Gestalt therapy broke with the distant, years-long Freudian analysis and staked everything on immediate experience in the here and now &ndash; an approach that helped thousands feel repressed emotions directly rather than merely talk about them. Perls's willingness to confront opened spaces in which genuine, often painful breakthroughs became possible.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The shadow lies in the harshness of that confrontation: critics accused him of sometimes serving his own show more than his clients' welfare, and not every participant was equipped to withstand public exposure on the hot seat. The lion with the Seven-wing wakes people up &ndash; but it does not always ask whether the waking should be gentle.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Legacy: Awareness Over Explanation</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Fritz Perls died in 1970 in Chicago, shortly after founding a Gestalt kibbutz project in Canada &ndash; in motion to the last, still searching for the next community, the next experiment. His last words, legend has it, were a characteristically direct rebuke &ndash; even in dying he did not let go of the readiness to react immediately rather than fall politely silent.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The Gestalt therapy he co-founded still shapes counseling, coaching, and psychotherapy today, far beyond its original school &ndash; its core principle, that awareness in the present moment heals more than any retrospective explanation, clearly bears the signature of the lion with the Seven-wing: no patient waiting, but full, unfiltered confrontation with what is alive right now.</p>

        <p class="krim-portrait-subtitle">Austrian composer and conductor, 1860&ndash;1911 &ndash; Animal correspondence: Armadillo</p>
      </div>
      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Armadillo at the Conductor's Podium</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>armadillo</strong> is the animal of the social Four &ndash; it does not hide its difference but carries it visibly into public life, into a group that both fascinates and excludes it. It seeks the stage precisely in order to be recognized there as the tragic exception.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Gustav Mahler was born in 1860 in Kalischt (Bohemia), one of 14 children, more than half of whom died in childhood &ndash; an early, ever-present experience of death and loss that ran through his entire body of work. As a Jew in the Catholic-dominated Habsburg Empire and as an artist with a radically idiosyncratic musical language, he experienced the feeling of being an outsider throughout his life &ndash; even at the height of his fame as director of the Vienna Court Opera (1897&ndash;1907), the most prestigious musical post in Europe.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Social Four: The Outsider in the Spotlight</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>social Four (SO4)</strong> paradoxically seeks out the group in order to make its own uniqueness visible there &ndash; it does not want to suffer in hiding but to live out its tragic difference in front of an audience. Mahler's position as opera director alongside radical compositional independence was exactly that: he stood at the center of Viennese musical life and yet composed music that often unsettled and divided his audience.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">His conversion to Catholicism in 1897 &ndash; a formal prerequisite for the Court Opera post &ndash; remained a publicly visible sign throughout his life of his standing between worlds: never quite belonging, but always at the center of attention. His famous statement that he was "thrice homeless" &ndash; as a Bohemian in Austria, as an Austrian among Germans, as a Jew throughout the world &ndash; captures this fundamental tension of the social Four precisely.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Five-Wing: The Symphony as a Blueprint of the World</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Five-wing (w5)</strong> gives the Four the drive not merely to express its emotional world but to cast it into a vast, thoroughly constructed system. Mahler's symphonies &ndash; often over 90 minutes long, with an enormous orchestral apparatus, chorus, and soloists &ndash; are exactly that: comprehensive, almost cosmological blueprints of the world, attempting to unite life, death, nature, and redemption in a single musical structure. His dictum that "a symphony must be like the world, it must embrace everything" is the purest formulation of this stance.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This analytical drive to construct also showed in his work as a conductor: Mahler was feared for his meticulous, uncompromising rehearsal work, his photographic memory for scores, and his ability to control even the smallest detail of an orchestral sound &ndash; a precision that pushed many musicians to their limits.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. Death as a Constant Companion</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Death runs through Mahler's work like a red thread &ndash; from the "Kindertotenlieder" (1904), composed after the early death of several of his siblings, to "Das Lied von der Erde" (1908), which he composed after being diagnosed with a serious heart condition and after the death of his own daughter Maria in 1907. Out of superstitious fear of the "curse of the ninth" &ndash; since several great composers died after completing their ninth symphony &ndash; he deliberately did not number this work as a symphony, giving it its own title instead.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In 1907 Mahler lost his daughter, his position at the Vienna Court Opera (through antisemitically motivated campaigns), and received the diagnosis of his own fatal heart disease, all within a few months &ndash; a triple blow that, typically for the social Four, he did not hide but translated directly into his compositional work.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Light and Shadow</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SO4w5 is the ability to turn <strong>existential suffering into monumental, universal art</strong> &ndash; Mahler's symphonies are today regarded as among the most significant works in classical music, precisely because they combine personal pain with compositional systematics.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The shadow showed itself in his uncompromising nature as a conductor and superior, which earned him a reputation as a tyrant, as well as in a deep restlessness that also burdened his marriage to Alma Mahler. The flip side of the social Four with a Five-wing: the search for perfect, all-encompassing expression can become so intense that little room remains for the people in one's immediate circle.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Armadillo That Captured the World in Music</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Gustav Mahler died in 1911 in Vienna, shortly before the premiere of his ninth symphony, which he would never conduct. Celebrated during his lifetime mainly as a conductor, he was only recognized decades after his death as one of the most significant composers in music history &ndash; his work is now seen as a bridge between late Romanticism and modernism.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The armadillo that stood at the center of Vienna's musical world yet never quite belonged, that translated its deepest experience of loss into vast, all-encompassing sound worlds &ndash; that is the lasting image of the social Four with a Five-wing: loneliness that becomes universality.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Raccoon</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>raccoon</strong> is the animal of the Self-Preservation Three – an animal that works with tireless diligence out of sight before it shows itself, and that draws its security from steady, demonstrable competence rather than loud self-promotion. Horst Tappert was born in 1923 in what is today the Elberfeld district of Wuppertal, was drafted during the Second World War, and was held as a prisoner of war. Only at the end of the 1950s, in his mid-thirties, did he begin his film and television career – considerably later than most of his later colleagues.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This late but all the more methodical career development is typical of the Self-Preservation Three: no early meteoric rise, but the patient building of role continuity and reliability in postwar German television, step by step, until it became load-bearing substance across decades.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Self-Preservation Three: Security Through a Role Carried Across Decades</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Self-Preservation Three (SP3)</strong> is the countertype of the Three – the subtype that seeks security not through a changing image but through demonstrable reliability proven over years. Naranjo called this subtype <em>Security</em>: one is not admired for reinventing oneself, but for doing what one can, again and again, with consistent quality.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">From 1974 to 1998, Tappert played Chief Inspector Derrick in 281 episodes – the same character for 24 years, without the series ever losing its pull. "Derrick" sold to 102 countries and is still regarded today as the most internationally successful German television series of all time. Not a spectacular outlier, but the result of decades of consistent, disciplined professionalism – the SP3, which draws its security from steadily delivered quality rather than constant reinvention.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Two-wing: A Quarter-Century of Collegial Bond</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Two-wing (w2)</strong> gives the Self-Preservation Three a genuine impulse toward connection and collegial closeness. At Tappert's side for all 24 years, <a href="#beruehmte-fritz-wepper">Fritz Wepper (SP1w9)</a> played the assistant Harry Klein – despite an eighteen-year age gap, the two quickly found a shared rhythm, both professionally and personally. Wepper himself later described their relationship as "a quarter-century of collegial harmony working together on television."</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This decades-long, load-bearing working relationship is typical SP3w2 energy: not a spectacular, short-lived chemistry, but a quietly grown, reliable bond that gave the format stability across decades – two people who carried each other through an entire professional life, without much fuss being made about it.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Untold Chapter</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Throughout his life, Tappert rarely spoke about his years during the Second World War. Only in 2013, five years after his death, did it become publicly known that in 1943, at age nineteen, he had been transferred from the Wehrmacht to the Waffen-SS and was listed there as a grenadier with the 3rd SS Division "Totenkopf" – information the sociologist Jörg Becker discovered by chance while researching an entirely different biography. Tappert himself had never mentioned this part of his past during his lifetime.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This decades-long, consistent reticence fits a pattern that recurs in the shadow form of the Self-Preservation Three: a flawless, reliable public facade behind which uncomfortable or burdensome facts remain concealed for decades without ever drawing public attention. Whether this amounted to a deliberate cover-up or simply the silence of a generation that rarely spoke about the war years cannot be established with final certainty in hindsight – what remains notable is that the discretion maintained for over fifty years was itself a remarkably consistent achievement.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Light and Shadow of the Self-Preservation Three</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SP3w2 lies in the ability to <strong>combine decades of reliable quality with genuine collegial warmth</strong>. With his role as Derrick, Tappert created one of the most defining figures of German television – not through spectacular reinvention, but through the plain, tireless consistency with which he carried it for a quarter-century.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The shadow of the Self-Preservation Three shows in exactly what constitutes its strength: the ability to maintain a flawless public facade so consistently that even weighty, uncomfortable truths remain invisible behind it for decades. In Tappert's case, this ability only became apparent posthumously – a reminder that the smooth, reliable surface of the SP3 does not automatically mean nothing lies hidden beneath it.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Legacy: The Raccoon That Turned a Character into a World Phenomenon</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Horst Tappert is among the most defining actors of postwar German television – not because he kept reinventing himself, but because he carried a single role with a consistency that accompanied millions of viewers worldwide across decades.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">From a late-starting postwar actor to the face of the most successful German television series of all time, carried by a nearly twenty-five-year collegial partnership: this is the Self-Preservation Three with a Two-wing in its most publicly visible form – consistency as a life's work, with all the light and all the shadow that so long-kept a silence can bring.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Elephant</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The elephant is the animal of the self-preservation Type 9, and no image fits James Levine more accurately. The elephant does not forget. It moves at its own rhythm, calm, grounding, with a presence that alters the room before it utters a single word. It needs no dramatic action to make an impact. Simply being there is enough.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">James Levine, born in Cincinnati in 1943 and passed away in 2021, was one of the most prominent conductors of the 20th century. For forty years, he led the Metropolitan Opera in New York—first as music director, later as music director emeritus/principal conductor. He built an orchestra that carried his sound like an instrument crafted specifically for him. No other modern conductor inhabited a single opera house so long, so profoundly, and so completely.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Self-Preservation Nine: Appetite</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The self-preservation Nine (SE9) expresses the sloth of the Nine through sensory abundance. Naranjo called this subtype Appetite: the joy of enjoyment, comfort, and deep immersion into what feeds oneself. The SE9 does not want to change the world. It wants to live in it—completely, warmly, surrounded by what brings it well-being.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Levine's appetite was music. Not as a career, not as an achievement, but as a way of life. He merged with the repertoire like the elephant with its herd: completely, quietly, out of deep belonging. Wagner, Verdi, Mozart, Mahler, Brahms—he did not merely learn them, he inhabited them. The Met was not his workplace. It was his territory, his home, his appetite made manifest in architecture.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The One Wing: The Inner Rigor</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The One wing gives the self-preservation Nine a quality that complements an SE9 with a weaker One wing: precision, rigor, and an inner standard that accepts no shortcuts. The SE9w8 seeks power. The SE9w1 seeks correctness in detail, in sound, in purity of expression.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Levine was famous for his enormous musical accuracy. He rehearsed with a patience and depth that astonished even veteran singers and orchestral musicians. The One wing provided the drive toward perfection; the Nine provided the tranquility that kept this perfection from ever feeling driven. The result was a conducting style that felt grand without ever needing to act grand.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Work: Forty Years at the Met</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Levine took over the musical direction of the Metropolitan Opera in 1976 at age thirty-three. What followed was one of the longest and most defining tenures in the history of grand opera. He systematically developed the Met Orchestra, introduced the opera house to new repertoire areas, and collaborated with the leading singers and directors of his era. The summer festival in Salzburg, years of collaboration with the Berlin Philharmonic, a brief stint as music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra (2004–2011)—his influence extended far beyond New York.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">His repertoire was remarkably broad: he conducted Wagner cycles as masterfully as Mozart operas, Brahms symphonies as well as contemporary premieres. Through it all, he preserved a distinct signature quality: a union of structural clarity and sensory warmth that epitomizes the elephant—grand, patient, radiating from within.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Light and Shadow: Appetite Without Bounds</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SE9w1 is its persistent depth. Over decades, Levine created a musical institution unthinkable without him. His standards were high, his dedication total, his love for music absolute. The One wing kept him on track; the Nine provided endurance.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The shadow: the appetite of the SE9 knows no natural limit. In 2017, public allegations of sexual abuse were raised against Levine by several men who described being abused by him as teenagers and young adults. The Met terminated his contract. Subsequent investigations corroborated the allegations in essential parts. What had remained hidden in the shadow of his immense power for decades came to light, leaving behind a fractured image: that of the great musician, and that of a man who treated his position as both territory and appetite without bounds.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Elephant Who Inhabited the House</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">James Levine shaped the Metropolitan Opera like no other. He gave it an unmistakable sound. He mentored generations of singers and musicians. And he demonstrated what the self-preservation Nine looks like at its best: total immersion, long endurance, and a presence that requires no explanation. In its darkest form, it also shows how an appetite without bounds can destroy everything it built. The elephant does not forget. And neither does history.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Elephant</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>elephant</strong> is the animal of the self-preservation Nine of the Enneagram &ndash; a being of enormous weight that nonetheless moves through the world unhurried, almost deliberate, that forgets nothing, and that never abandons anyone to whom it has once pledged loyalty. Johannes Brahms was this elephant: massive in his artistic stature, unshakable in his bonds, and possessed of a memory that carried a single friendship across four decades.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The German composer Johannes Brahms, born in 1833 in Hamburg as the son of a town musician, earned money as a teenager as a teenager playing piano in the dockside taverns of St. Pauli &ndash; a hard, spare schooling that kept him modest for the rest of his life, even after fame had made him one of the wealthiest composers in Europe.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. Self-Preservation Nine: Appetite in Small Things</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Naranjo called the <strong>self-preservation Nine (SP9)</strong> <em>Appetite</em>: peace not through grand gestures, but through the reliable, often unremarkable ritual &ndash; the same tavern, the same walk, the same summer retreat. Brahms embodied this pattern down to the last detail. Every summer he withdrew to the same rural towns to compose, sat reliably in his regular Viennese haunts over beer and cigars each evening, and clung to his habits with a stubbornness that amused friends and sometimes drove them to despair.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Despite his considerable wealth, he lived deliberately simply &ndash; in modest Viennese rooms, without pomp, without servants. His money flowed instead quietly and mostly anonymously to musicians in need, to the families of former companions, to the young Antonín Dvořák, whose career he decisively advanced. The self-preservation Nine seeks security not in possession but in the familiar &ndash; and Brahms found his security in being needed, without anyone finding out.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Eight-Wing: The Blunt Edge Behind the Silence</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Eight-wing</strong> gives the self-preservation Nine something a Nine with a weaker Eight wing often lacks: an edge that is not negotiable. Brahms was famous &ndash; and infamous &ndash; for his cutting wit. Leaving a gathering once, he is said to have remarked on his way out: "If there is anyone here I have not yet insulted, I apologize." This is not merely an anecdote about spite &ndash; it is the Eight-wing equipping the conflict-averse Nine with a cutting directness no one expects.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This edge showed most clearly in the so-called "War of the Romantics": while Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner drove forward program music and radical harmonic innovation with the "New German School," Brahms &ndash; together with the critic Eduard Hanslick &ndash; positioned himself as an uncompromising defender of the classical forms of Bach and Beethoven. He never retreated from this dispute, nor did he actively seek it &ndash; but once he had taken a position, nothing could move him from it. That is the Nine with the Eight-wing: patient right up to the point where it no longer is.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Passion: Sloth as Persistent Refinement</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The passion of the Nine is called <strong>sloth</strong> &ndash; not laziness, but the persistence in the familiar, the refusal to be rushed. In Brahms this became a creative patience of almost inhuman proportions: he worked on his First Symphony for over 21 years, because he saw himself in the overwhelming shadow of Beethoven and scrutinized every bar until it could withstand comparison. The conductor Hans von Bülow later respectfully called the finished work "Beethoven's Tenth."</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This sloth was not a lack of ambition but its exact opposite: a persistence that would not be hurried, not even by his own talent. Brahms destroyed countless early works that did not satisfy him, and preferred to publish nothing rather than something unfinished. The Nine, who seeks security in the familiar, found that security here in classical form itself &ndash; and refused to leave it before having fully mastered it.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Robert and Clara Schumann: The Shared Eight</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">In 1853 the 20-year-old, still unknown Brahms played for the Schumanns in Düsseldorf. Robert Schumann &ndash; himself a sexual Seven with an Eight-wing (SX7w8) &ndash; instantly recognized in him a coming master and proclaimed it to the world in his essay "Neue Bahnen" without any reservation. Two Eight-wing natures met here: the stormy, instantly and completely enthusiastic Schumann, and the more reserved but equally unyielding Brahms. It was as if the Eight in both of them recognized at once what lay in the other.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">When Schumann, only a year later, jumped into the Rhine in a state of mental collapse and had himself admitted to the asylum at Endenich, it was Brahms who stayed. He moved to Düsseldorf, supported Clara Schumann in caring for their seven children, took charge of the family's finances, and visited Robert regularly at the asylum &ndash; while Clara herself was barely permitted to see him. This is the elephant's loyalty of the self-preservation Nine in its rawest form: where another might have moved on after the first burst of enthusiasm, Brahms stayed &ndash; for decades, until Clara Schumann's death in 1896. He himself died only eleven months later. The elephant who forgets nothing had, to the very end, not forgotten to whom he owed his first great beginning.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Legacy: The Keeper Who Never Left</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Brahms left behind a body of work that did not preserve the classical tradition as a museum piece but thought it through to its final consequence &ndash; four symphonies, chamber music of unmatched density, the German Requiem, composed in memory of his mother. No composer of the 19th century took the forms of Bach (SX1w9) and Beethoven (SX6w5) so seriously while penetrating them so personally.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Yet the true legacy of the SP9w8 lies not in the notes alone. It lies in the loyalty of a man who, seeking neither fame nor recognition, stayed with a family that had once discovered him for forty years out of quiet, unshakable devotion. The elephant with the Eight-wing: patient enough to refine a symphony for two decades &ndash; and stubborn enough never to abandon a loyalty once given.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Peacock</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>peacock</strong> is the animal of the sexual Three &ndash; and barely any image fits Kai Pflaume better. The peacock does not display its most beautiful plumage in order to impress. It displays it because it belongs to him. His splendor is not a performance, it is an expression of his nature. Anyone who observes a peacock senses: this is real. This needs no stage.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The German host Kai Pflaume has been present in German television for more than thirty years &ndash; and without scandal, without rupture, without changing his mask. He has remained the same: warm, curious, personal. That is the secret of the peacock. He does not radiate because he must. He radiates because his light comes from within.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Sexual Three: Magnetism as Life Theme</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>sexual Three (SX3)</strong> is, in the Enneagram tradition, the subtype that makes personal attraction its life&apos;s work. Not success before the masses &ndash; that would be the social Three &ndash; but the direct, personal resonance with the person opposite. The SX3 asks: <em>Do I have an effect on you? Am I desirable to you?</em> Its charisma is intimate, immediate, at eye level.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This explains Kai Pflaume&apos;s presentation style precisely. He sits opposite a contestant on &bdquo;Wer weiß denn sowas?&ldquo; &ndash; and that contestant feels seen. Not as a television guest, but as a person. Pflaume looks carefully. He asks follow-up questions. He does not laugh for the camera; he laughs because something genuinely amuses him. This quality &ndash; real presence in direct contact &ndash; is the hallmark of the SX3.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Claudio Naranjo called this subtype <em>Masculinity/Femininity</em>: the embodiment of attraction in its purest, most personal form. In the healthy SX3, this is not a facade &ndash; it is a genuine gift. The ability to see something special in every person opposite and to make that perceptible to them.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Two-wing: Warmth as Second Nature</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Two-wing (w2)</strong> adds something decisive to the Three energy: genuine care. While a Three with a weaker Two wing scores with charisma and performance, the SX3w2 gains a second force &ndash; sincere interest in others, the joy of doing something good for someone. The Two gives, not in order to expect something in return, but because giving is its nature.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In Kai Pflaume this shows in the way he treats contestants &ndash; patient, encouraging, never at others&apos; expense. In &bdquo;Klein gegen Groß&ldquo; children stand alongside world champions. Pflaume moderates this encounter so that the person always stands at the center, not the ratings. This is not a concept, it is character.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The SX3w2 does not only radiate &ndash; he also warms. He does not only attract &ndash; he also cares. This difference explains why Pflaume has won trust over decades that burns out quickly with other presenters.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. Light and Shadow of the Sexual Three</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Every Enneagram type carries its light and its shadow. The light of the SX3 is obvious: charisma, warmth, the ability to touch people directly. The shadow is subtler: the Three can confuse its identity with its effect. <em>I am how others see me.</em> When no one admires anymore, who am I then?</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The karmic pattern of the Three is <strong>deceit</strong> &ndash; not as malicious intent, but as a structural risk. The Three can begin to play a role so convincingly that it forgets it is a role. The image becomes the identity. The peacock forgets what it looks like without its plumage.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In Kai Pflaume this shadow is barely visible &ndash; and that is a sign of healthy development. He has apparently found a stable inner foundation that holds independently of ratings. Thirty years of television without burnout, without scandal, without an image change: this speaks for an SX3 who knows his shadow and has learned to live with it.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. The Healing Path: From Effect to Authenticity</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The healing path of the Three leads from external effect to inner truth. The growing Three learns to define its worth from within &ndash; not from others&apos; reactions. From <em>I am desirable</em> comes: <em>I am.</em> From attraction comes authenticity. From charisma comes character.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Kai Pflaume embodies this development with rare purity. His radiance has become real &ndash; not because he stopped radiating, but because the source of that light is no longer the camera. The peacock needs no audience. He is beautiful, even when no one is watching.</p>

        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Goose</strong> is the animal of the social One &ndash; an animal that lives within a flock, orients itself by clear rules and rank order, and passes its knowledge on to the group rather than keeping it to itself. Konrad Lorenz, the Austrian zoologist and founder of modern ethology, became world-famous for his research on exactly this animal: the greylag goose. In 1989, the German magazine Der Spiegel called him the "Einstein of the animal soul."</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">As with several other animal-researcher portraits in this compass, a striking pattern confirms itself here too: the Enneagram's animal correspondences were fixed long before anyone knew of Lorenz's life's work. That the world's most famous greylag goose researcher was himself a social One &ndash; the type whose animal in this compass exactly matches his own research subject &ndash; is one of the most striking matches in this series.</p>

          <p class="vb-intro">According to Naranjo, the <strong>social One (SO1)</strong> seeks not personal perfection but the perfection of the community &ndash; appearing as teacher, reformer, or moral authority who knows how things ought to be done, and conveys that knowledge with conviction. Lorenz, born in Vienna in 1903, began raising greylag geese as a young man and, in 1935, discovered the phenomenon of imprinting: chicks that see no parent shortly after hatching instead follow the first moving object they encounter &ndash; in Lorenz's famous photographs, himself, trailed by a line of waddling goslings.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">From this single observation, Lorenz systematically built an entire scientific discipline: ethology, the biological study of innate behavior. Together with Niko Tinbergen and Karl von Frisch, he received the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for it &ndash; the first such award for purely behavioral-biological research. His book "King Solomon's Ring" (1949) brought him to a wide audience and established him as a moral voice on questions of animal welfare and, later, the environment.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Nine-Wing: Patience as Research Method</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">An SO1 with a more pronounced Two-wing would likely have pursued its reform work more directly, personally, and confrontationally. In Lorenz, a patient, almost meditative disposition shows instead: he spent decades at Altenberg near Vienna simply observing greylag geese, jackdaws, and other animals over long periods without intervening &ndash; a quiet, unhurried endurance characteristic of the Nine-wing. His popular science books were not polemical but narrative, warm, and carried by an almost childlike wonder at nature.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">At the same time, the One's core remained palpable: Lorenz advanced his scientific theses &ndash; for instance in his controversial book "On Aggression" (1963), on the evolution of aggression &ndash; with an unshakeable conviction that he had correctly identified the underlying principles. This combination of gentle patience and firm inner certainty is the SO1w9 in its characteristic form.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. Light and Shadow: Science and Nazi Entanglement</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">A complete picture of Konrad Lorenz cannot omit his entanglement with National Socialism. In 1938, shortly after Austria's annexation by Nazi Germany, Lorenz joined the Nazi party. In his membership application, he described himself as "always a National Socialist" and wrote that his entire scientific work served National Socialist ideas. In 1942, he took part as a psychologist in studies in occupied Posen that contributed to the scientific underpinning of Nazi population policy. In publications of that period, he also advanced ideas of "racial hygiene," dressed in the pseudoscientific language of behavioral biology.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">After the war, Lorenz long obscured the true extent of this entanglement. Only in 2015 &ndash; 26 years after his death &ndash; did the University of Salzburg posthumously revoke his honorary doctorate, explicitly citing his Nazi past and its later concealment. This is the dark underside of the SO1: the unshakeable certainty of possessing the "right principle" can turn catastrophic in the wrong historical context &ndash; when the supposedly right thing is itself borrowed from a dehumanizing ideology. A serious appraisal of his scientific work does not exclude this responsibility, but includes it.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Late Activism: From Ethologist to Conservationist</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">In the final phase of his life, Lorenz turned increasingly to nature conservation. In 1984, he became a prominent figure in the "Konrad Lorenz Volksbegehren" (people's petition), opposing a planned power plant in the Hainburg wetlands near Vienna &ndash; one of Austria's first major environmental movements, which significantly contributed to the founding of the Donau-Auen National Park. Until his death in 1989, he kept returning to his greylag geese at Altenberg, whose behavior he documented over decades.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Goose That Explained the Animal to Humanity</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Konrad Lorenz's life's work shows the social One with a Nine-wing at its most effective &ndash; and, at once, most cautionary: a patient, decades-long devotion to a single field of research that founded an entire scientific discipline, combined with an unshakeable certainty that led to groundbreaking insight in the right context &ndash; and to complicity in one of history's darkest chapters in the wrong one.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The goose lives within the flock, follows clear imprinting, and passes its knowledge on to the next generation &ndash; exactly what Lorenz did for the science of ethology. But history serves as a warning: even the firmest inner certainty does not replace the moral scrutiny of whom, and what cause, one places it in service of.</p>

        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Hippopotamus</strong> is the animal of the self-preservation Two &ndash; an animal most at ease within a tight, familiar circle, developing its full strength there before ever stepping into the spotlight. Lionel Boyce, born in Inglewood, California, to a water-delivery driver father and a sheriff's deputy mother, found his creative origin not as a solo act but within the hip-hop collective Odd Future – a close, chosen circle out of which he slowly emerged as an individual figure.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Within the group he was known as "L-Boy," largely a non-musical member in the best sense – someone who contributed to cohesion without standing at the center himself. Only over years did this background role grow into an independent acting career.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Self-Preservation Two: Care Within the Closest Creative Circle</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Naranjo called the <strong>self-preservation Two (SE2)</strong> <em>Me First</em> &ndash; not in a selfish sense, but existentially: closeness first arises within the closest, most reliable circle. Boyce's decades-long creative partnership with Tyler, the Creator is exactly this pattern: together they co-created the series <em>Loiter Squad</em> (2012–2014) and <em>The Jellies!</em> (2015–2017), and in 2015 they founded the production company Bald Fade Productions together.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Rather than spreading his creative energy across as many loose contacts as possible, Boyce invested it for years in the same close friendship and collaboration – a form of care measured not by reach, but by reliability toward one's closest creative companions.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Three-Wing: From the Background to an Emmy Nomination</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Three-wing (w3)</strong> gives the self-preservation Two the drive to still seek visible, publicly effective success from a secure, close base. Boyce's role as Marcus, the pastry chef in <em>The Bear</em> (since 2022), earned him an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series – a clear step out of Odd Future's collective background into an independent, publicly recognized role.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Notably, even as a celebrated supporting actor, Boyce remained loyal to collaboration with his closest creative circle rather than focusing exclusively on a solo career – the Three-wing seeks visible success without giving up the SE2's reliable base to get there.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. Light and Shadow of the Self-Preservation Two</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SE2w3 lies in the ability to develop an independent, publicly visible career out of a decades-long, close creative partnership – without leaving the original base, his friendship with Tyler, the Creator, and the Odd Future circle.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The fate pattern of the Two is <strong>pride</strong> &ndash; the conviction of being indispensable to the success of one's own close group. In the SE2w3, this can combine with the question of how much of one's own identity remains tied to a particular group or collaboration, even once enough independent success exists to break free of it.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. The Work: From Odd Future to Celebrated Supporting Actor</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">From his role as "L-Boy" within Odd Future through the series he created with Tyler, the Creator to his Emmy-nominated role in <em>The Bear</em>, a single thread runs through Boyce's work: creative closeness first, visible success as a consequence, never as the primary goal.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The hippopotamus does not leave its ancestral waters to please others – it lets its closest circle grow without ever leaving it. Lionel Boyce's path from the creative background of a hip-hop collective to celebrated television actor shows this pattern at its purest: success that grows out of loyalty to one's closest companions, not out of leaving one's own base.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Gorilla</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The gorilla is the strongest animal of the rainforest and the warmest. It lives in a tight family bond, nurtures its relationships, protects its own with a power it rarely needs to display. It doesn't need to seek out a fight; its presence alone suffices. And it loves food not as a weakness, but as an expression of life, joy, abundance. The gorilla is generous with what it has. And it never forgets who harmed it.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Mariah Carey is the best-selling female artist of all time—or at least one of the contenders for that title, depending on how you count. She has eighteen number-one singles on the US Billboard Hot 100—more than any other solo artist in the chart's history. Her voice spans five octaves, including the whistle register she was the first to popularize. And she wrote a single Christmas song—All I Want for Christmas Is You (1994)—that continues to bring her several million dollars annually. Mariah Carey is the gorilla: warm, powerful, lavish, and fully prepared to look those who stand in her way straight in the eye.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Family: Abundance as Home</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Claudio Naranjo called the self-preservation Type 7 Family because this subtype does not seek security in the wide world, but in the tightest circle. It builds nests: out of familiarity, warmth, enjoyment. And it gathers experiences, people, pleasures, security. Abundance for the SE7 is not excess; it is proof that life is good and will remain good.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Carey grew up in precarious circumstances: her parents separated when she was three years old, and she moved from place to place with her mother. Her mother, Patricia Hickey, was an Irish-American opera singer and vocal coach; her father, Alfred Roy Carey, was of Venezuelan-African American origin and an aeronautical engineer. Mariah grew up between two worlds—too Black for her mother's white environment, too light for her father's Black environment—and learned early on to make herself her own home. At eighteen, she moved to New York City, waitressed, styled hair, and worked tirelessly toward her breakthrough.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">When she finally built her nest, she built it big: penthouses, private jets, butterflies as decor, champagne on the return flight. Her fans—the Lambs—are not just an audience, but a family. She communicates with them directly and keeps them in her inner circle. That is the SE7: the nest is never big enough, and whoever belongs to it truly belongs.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Eight Wing: Power as a Shield</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The Eight wing gives the self-preservation Seven a quality an SE7 with a weaker Eight wing does not always show: the will to power, readiness for confrontation, and a keen radar for control and its loss. Where the SE7 seeks joy and avoids discomfort, the Eight wing adds: "And if someone threatens my joy, I will let them know."</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The defining experience of Carey's life was her marriage to music executive Tommy Mottola (1993–1998), the then-head of Sony Music. Mottola had discovered her, built her up, and then controlled her: her home was guarded, her phone calls monitored, her circle subject to approval. Carey later described it as a kind of golden cage. When she freed herself, she wrote Fantasy, Emotions, and ultimately the album Butterfly (1997)—an R&B pivot Mottola would never have approved. The Eight wing taught her: loss of control is more dangerous than the big performance. And: whoever has once lost control never surrenders it voluntarily again.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The diva legends that have developed since then—the butterflies in the room, the specific drinking water, the famous line "I don't know her" when asked about Jennifer Lopez—are no slip-up. They are a protective wall. "Whoever doesn't respect me doesn't exist for me." That is the Eight wing of the gorilla: clear boundaries.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Work: Five Octaves for Eternity</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Mariah Carey's debut album Mariah Carey (1990) produced five consecutive number-one singles in the US—a record previously held only by Whitney Houston. It was followed by Emotions (1991), Music Box (1993), Merry Christmas (1994)—the best-selling Christmas album of all time to the present day—Daydream (1995), and Butterfly (1997). In that decade, she was simply the biggest pop voice in the world.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In 2001, she collapsed publicly. The album Glitter and the movie of the same name flopped catastrophically; Carey suffered a public nervous breakdown documented in live appearances and a tearful, seemingly incoherent visit to Total Request Live. She disappeared from the public eye and received inpatient treatment. It was the lowest point of her career and simultaneously the beginning of the most important work she ever did.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The Emancipation of Mimi (2005) was one of the greatest comebacks in pop history. The album went fifteen times platinum in the US; the single We Belong Together was the most played song of the decade in America. Carey didn't just return—she ascended higher than ever before. That is the SE7w8: you don't defeat the gorilla. You only make it stronger.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Light and Shadow: The Diva and the Child</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SE7w8 is its capacity for joy. Mariah Carey laughs loudly, loves opulently, gives generously. Her memoir The Meaning of Mariah Carey (2020) is no self-pity project, but an honest, often humorous look at a life full of ruptures and ascents. She sugarcoats nothing and apologizes for nothing. The gorilla principle: I was here. I survived. Here is my story.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The shadow: the SE7 avoids what hurts. Carey acted publicly for years as if she had no bad days—as if the diva persona were not a mask, but reality itself. The Eight wing reinforces this: showing weakness is dangerous. The result is images that are sometimes more self-protection than self-expression. The famous rider clauses, the extravagances, the distance from anything uncontrollable—that is not just diva behavior. That is a human who once fell too deep into a world without control and will never allow that to happen again.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Her children—twins Moroccan and Monroe, born in 2011 with Nick Cannon—are the one thing for which the diva pose drops. In interviews about them, Carey appears unfiltered, warm, fully present. That is the gorilla without the protective wall: the mother in the nest.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Gorilla That Owns Christmas</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Mariah Carey owns Christmas. That is no metaphor. All I Want for Christmas Is You (1994) now has over a billion streams on Spotify alone, and the song returns to the charts every year as if it had a right to be there. It does. Carey wrote it, by her own account, in fifteen minutes on a piano one afternoon.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Five octaves, thirty-five years in the spotlight, eighteen number-one singles, a public breakdown, a comeback that changed history, and an immortal Christmas song: that is the gorilla. It builds its nest. It protects its own. It sings—and when it sings, the world listens.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Raccoon</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>raccoon</strong> is the animal of the Self-Preservation Three – an animal that works with tireless diligence out of sight and builds a functioning system out of limited means. Michael Dell was born in 1965 in Houston, Texas, and in 1984, as a nineteen-year-old pre-med student, began assembling and selling computers out of his dorm room at the University of Texas with roughly $1,000 in startup capital.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">By the second half of his freshman year, he had already sold $80,000 worth of computers – a figure he used to convince his parents to let him give up medical school for his own business. Not a spontaneous stroke of genius, but early proof that a working business model actually held up, before he committed to it fully.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Self-Preservation Three: Operational Discipline Over Self-Promotion</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Self-Preservation Three (SP3)</strong> is the countertype of the Three – the subtype that seeks security not through public image but through demonstrable, verifiable competence. Naranjo called this subtype <em>Security</em>: one is not admired for selling oneself well, but for actually delivering what one promises. Dell's company generated six million dollars in revenue in its first full year of business and made him, at twenty-seven in 1992, the youngest CEO of a Fortune 500 company up to that point.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">His company was among the first to consistently implement just-in-time inventory management – components were ordered only once an actual customer order existed, which cut costs and increased efficiency. This method was no marketing slogan but lived operational discipline: the SP3, which draws its security from a system that actually works, not from how it is presented publicly.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Two-wing: Customer Closeness and Shared Philanthropy</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Two-wing (w2)</strong> gives the Self-Preservation Three a genuine impulse toward connection – in Dell this shows in the direct sales model that from the start relied on immediate customer contact rather than anonymous retail, and in a corporate culture consistently oriented toward customer satisfaction rather than pure brand management.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Together with his wife Susan, he founded the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation in 1999, initially focused on children in poverty in Texas, then across the entire United States, in South Africa, and in India. The two have since pledged over $10 billion to nonprofits and social enterprises – in 2024 alone around $308 million, roughly twice as much as the year before. The Two-wing translates business success into concrete, measurable support for others.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. Taking the Company Private, 2013</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">In 2013, Dell carried out one of the largest leveraged buyouts in technology history to take his own company off the stock market – a decision that ran against the short-term expectations of Wall Street and instead enabled long-term, structural transformation. Not a spectacular public gesture, but a sober, operational decision to restore the substance the company risked losing under permanent quarterly pressure.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This episode shows the typical SP3 logic: security does not come from pleasing external expectations, but from consistent control over one's own operational foundations – if necessary, even against the tide of public opinion.</p>

          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SP3w2 lies in the ability to <strong>combine operational substance with genuine care for others</strong> – Dell not only built one of the largest technology companies in the world, but consistently translated the wealth it generated into measurable charitable impact, together with his wife as an equal partner.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The Three's fatal flaw is <strong>vanity</strong> – subtler in the SP3 than in the louder Three subtypes, but present nonetheless: the need to keep confirming one's own worth through ever-new, verifiable successes. Dell's path from a dorm room to a globally operating technology corporation shows a discipline that produced impressive results but rarely paused to simply enjoy the success already achieved.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Golden Retriever</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Golden Retriever</strong> is the animal of the social Two &ndash; an animal whose entire being is oriented toward caring for many at once, without calculation, without selection, out of an inner need to be needed and to give unconditionally. No accidental animal for a woman who, for decades, received hundreds of strangers each day, silently met every single one's eyes, and gave each of them, for a few seconds, her full, undivided attention.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Mother Meera, born Kamala Reddy in 1960 in the south Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, was revered by her followers as a spiritual master and embodiment of the Divine Feminine. From the 1980s onward she lived mostly in Germany, first in Thalheim near Balduinstein, where for decades she regularly gave so-called darshans &ndash; silent audiences in which visitors from around the world knelt before her one by one to receive her gaze. The Golden Retriever, whose attention is not confined to a single relationship but extends to everyone who comes to it.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Social Two: Care as a Universal Calling</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>social Two (SO2)</strong> seeks belonging not through the one special relationship, but through its role within a larger community &ndash; through being needed by many at once. Naranjo describes this subtype as the one with the strongest missionary streak of all Two subtypes: it wants not only to be close to individual people, but to serve a whole group, a movement, a cause.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Mother Meera's entire public work followed this logic. For decades, week after week, she received hundreds of visitors from around the world for darshan &ndash; not as exclusive attention for a chosen few, but as an open offering to anyone who came. No admission fee, no formal membership, no precondition. The social Two recognizes its purpose in offering as many people as possible the same unconditional attention that others would reserve only for their closest circle.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The One-Wing: Quiet Discipline Rather Than Loud Preaching</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>One-wing (w1)</strong> gives the social Two an inner discipline and purity that clearly distinguishes it from the more impulsive, more sociable Two with a Three-wing. Rather than pushing itself into the foreground through charisma and radiance, the SO2w1 has its effect through restraint, consistency, and an almost ascetic adherence to its own chosen form of service.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Mother Meera spoke not a single word during her darshans. For decades the same silent ritual repeated itself, unchanged, without theatrics, without speeches, without sermons. This persistence in the same, reduced form is the One-wing at work: what matters is not the variety of means, but the purity and consistency of the one chosen practice. Her few books, above all "Answers," are sober, clear, without rhetorical ornament &ndash; the One demands precision even from its own message.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Work: The Gaze as a Gift</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The center of Mother Meera's work was the darshan itself: visitors knelt before her one after another, she briefly placed her hands on their heads and looked directly into their eyes for a few seconds. Followers described this moment as deeply moving, some as transformative. Whether one interprets this experience religiously or not, the sheer constancy and devotion with which she maintained this practice for hundreds of thousands of people over decades is an extraordinary example of lived SO2w1 energy.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">After years in Germany she later moved her residence back to India, where she continued to receive visitors, though on a reduced scale, until her death in 2023. Her books and the centers founded by followers around the world continue to carry her work forward.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Light and Shadow of the Social Two</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SO2w1 is a rare combination of universal kindness and disciplined service: attention that is not reserved for a favored few, but consistently open to everyone who comes. Mother Meera's decades-long, unchanged practice shows a constancy that is rare &ndash; no scandals, no exploitation of her position, no self-promotion beyond what the role required.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The fate pattern of the Two is <strong>pride</strong> &ndash; the deep conviction of being indispensable to others, of being able to give them something they lack themselves. For spiritual teacher figures like Mother Meera, this pattern carries a particular risk: the role of embodying the divine can blur the line between one's own person and the projections followers place upon it. The One-wing softens this danger through restraint and formal discipline, but it does not resolve it entirely.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Path of Healing: From Giving to Being</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The healing path of the Two leads from giving to receiving &ndash; from the question <em>Am I needed?</em> to the recognition <em>I am already worthy, even without giving anything.</em> For the SO2w1, this path shows in the ability to live one's own service not as constant proof of worth, but as a free gift offered from inner abundance.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Mother Meera's wordless darshan can be read as exactly this expression: no speech, no argument, no attempt to persuade &ndash; only a quiet presence that gives the other person room to meet themselves. The Golden Retriever that does not bark to demand attention, but simply is there, loyal, constant, for whoever comes.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Chihuahua who always had a Chihuahua by her side</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Chihuahua</strong> is the animal of the Sexual Four &ndash; small, but with a presence that fills the entire room, dramatic in every gesture, always searching for the one intense bond that outshines everything else. Few images embody this principle as literally as Paris Hilton with her most famous companion: the Chihuahua Tinkerbell, who barely left her side for over a decade, was carried through public life in diamond-studded outfits, and became the symbol of an entire fashion trend &ndash; the "handbag dog."</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Hilton, great-granddaughter of hotel founder Conrad Hilton, first became known in the late 1990s as part of New York's society scene before becoming world-famous from 2003 onward with the reality series "The Simple Life." Her style &ndash; tracksuits, rhinestones, and that small dog in the handbag &ndash; shaped mass taste for years, long before influencer marketing was a term anyone used.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Sexual Four: intensity as both stage and shield</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Naranjo called the <strong>Sexual Four (SX4)</strong> "Competition": it seeks its significance not in quiet withdrawal, but in a dramatic, impossible-to-ignore presence that aims to win the competition for attention and intensity. Over the years, Hilton perfected a public persona &ndash; a breathy, girlish voice, an almost theatrically staged naivety &ndash; so effective that it became a template for an entire generation of later reality and social-media personalities.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Yet this very persona was, as Hilton later revealed herself, a shield: in interviews she described herself as "a very naturally shy person" and explained that her real voice was deeper and calmer than the public had ever heard. The Sexual Four shows its most paradoxical side here: building a stage persona of such intensity that it could completely conceal the vulnerable self behind it for decades.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Three-wing: the perfectly staged brand</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Three-wing (w3)</strong> gives the Four an unerring sense for image, impact, and marketing &ndash; its own intensity is not only felt but strategically translated into a successful, recognizable brand. Hilton built a business empire out of her public figure: perfumes, fashion lines, a DJ career, entrepreneurial ventures &ndash; a body of work that went far beyond her original society fame, and one that later reality stars, including Kim Kardashian, have explicitly credited her with paving the way for.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Tinkerbell, too, was part of this deliberate staging: the Chihuahua appeared regularly on "The Simple Life," became a small celebrity in her own right, and reinforced exactly the image of boundless, glamorous playfulness that Hilton embodied as a brand. The Three-wing knows precisely which detail completes an image.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. Light and shadow</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SX4w3 is its ability to turn <strong>inner intensity into a culture-shaping public figure</strong> &ndash; Hilton verifiably changed how an entire generation understood fame, fashion, and public self-presentation, long before social media made this mechanism accessible to everyone.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The shadow only showed decades later, in the documentary "This Is Paris" (2020), in which Hilton deliberately dropped the facade and spoke about painful childhood experiences at so-called "troubled teen" institutions. She described how liberating it was to finally be seen as a vulnerable human being instead of a perfect persona. The flip side of the Sexual Four with a Three-wing: building a stage persona so convincing that the world barely glimpsed the actual self behind it for decades.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. The Chihuahua that shows a heart beats beneath the armor</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Tinkerbell died in 2015 at age fourteen, deeply mourned by Hilton, who spoke openly about her close, years-long bond with the small dog. What remains is a double image: the glamorous, unmistakable persona with the Chihuahua in her handbag &ndash; and the woman who, decades later, found the courage to publicly set that armor down.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Few images could stand more fittingly for the Sexual Four with a Three-wing: a small animal of boundless, unmistakable presence at the side of a woman whose own equally intense public staging only late in life gave way to a glimpse of a tender, vulnerable inner self.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Owl Who Philosophized in Bed</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>owl</strong> is the animal of Type 5 &ndash; a creature that withdraws in order to see clearly, that guards its energy like a precious reserve. Few habits embody this as literally as René Descartes's famous morning routine: already as a pupil at the Jesuit college of La Flèche, he was permitted, for health reasons, to stay in bed until late morning &ndash; an exception he kept for the rest of his life. His most important thoughts, he himself said, came to him in these undisturbed morning hours, when no one had access to him.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Born in 1596 in La Haye en Touraine, he served briefly as an officer in various European armies &ndash; less for combat than for the chance to travel and observe the world from a safe distance. On November 10, 1619, in a heated room in southern Germany, he had, according to tradition, the series of dreams that convinced him to devote his life to the search for a secure, unshakeable method of knowledge.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. Self-Preservation Five: The Castle in Exile</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Naranjo called the <strong>self-preservation Five (SP5)</strong> <em>Castle</em>: one's own territory becomes a fortress that limits the world's access as much as possible. In 1628 Descartes left France and moved to the Netherlands &ndash; a country that offered him the intellectual freedom and anonymity he sought. Over the following twenty-odd years, he reportedly changed his address more than twenty times, often without telling even close correspondents where he lived.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">He conducted most of his extensive correspondence through the priest and scholar Marin Mersenne in Paris, who acted as a kind of filter: Mersenne collected questions and comments from other thinkers before forwarding them to Descartes. Here the castle of the SP5 protects not through walls but through distance and mediation &ndash; contact happens, but only on one's own terms, in one's own time, filtered through trusted intermediaries.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Six-Wing: Caution as a Survival Strategy</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Six-wing (w6)</strong> gives the self-preservation Five a watchful, often anxious caution toward external threats. In 1633 Descartes was on the verge of publishing his physical treatise "Le Monde" (The World), which, like Galileo, argued for a heliocentric universe. When he learned that the Inquisition in Rome had condemned Galileo for exactly this, he immediately withdrew the finished manuscript and never published it in his lifetime. "I would not want," he wrote to a friend, "anything of mine to be published that contains a single word the Church might disapprove of."</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The same caution shaped his entire method: in the "Meditationes de prima philosophia" (1641) he began with radical, methodical doubt about everything that could be doubted in the slightest &ndash; in order to arrive, in the end, at a single, absolutely certain fixed point: <em>Cogito, ergo sum</em> &ndash; I think, therefore I am. This is the Six-wing in its purest philosophical form: security is not assumed but earned step by step, through systematic distrust of every possibility of error.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Behind this lies an even more fundamental trait of the self-preservation Five: as the reinforcement type of the Five, it pursues its intrinsic motivation &ndash; the search for knowledge, understanding, and, at best, wisdom &ndash; not in moderation but intensified. This intensification is a compensation: all three subtypes of the Head Triad (Five, Six, Seven) carry a trust deficit within them, and the self-preservation Five meets it by making head energy &ndash; thinking itself &ndash; its most secure, most fortified territory. Descartes's <em>Cogito, ergo sum</em> is the purest philosophical expression of exactly this stance: in the end he can conceive of nothing existing with certainty beyond thought itself &ndash; thought becomes the only unshakeable ground. From today's perspective, this dualism in its strict form is outdated, yet the underlying conviction that secure knowledge arises first through the thinking mind's grasp of the world still shapes large parts of science and the prevailing spirit of the age.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Foundation: A Knowledge Nothing Could Shake</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Descartes wanted not merely to offer a new theory but to place the whole of philosophy on a foundation as secure as geometry &ndash; hence his preference for mathematical clarity, which he also expressed in the analytic geometry he helped found (the Cartesian coordinate system). Doubt was for him no end in itself but a tool: one clears away every uncertain ground until only what cannot possibly be doubted remains.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This methodical rigor also showed in how he treated his own body: Descartes drew a radical distinction between res cogitans (the thinking mind) and res extensa (the extended, material world, including one's own body) &ndash; a dualism that let him regard thought as the only truly secure territory, independent of the uncertainties of physical existence.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Light and Shadow</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of SP5w6 shows in the sheer clarity of Descartes's method: Cartesian doubt became the starting point of all modern philosophy, his rationalism the counterpart to British empiricism, his analytic geometry the bridge between algebra and space. Scarcely any thinker has placed the self-awareness of the subject &ndash; "I think" &ndash; so influentially at the center of philosophy.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The shadow lies in the price of this certainty: his mind-body dualism left behind a problem still unresolved today &ndash; how can mind and body, if they are such radically separate substances, interact at all? Descartes himself attempted an answer via the pineal gland, a solution scarcely any of his successors found convincing. The castle meant to protect absolute certainty thereby created a new, deep rift between inner and outer, thought and world.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Owl Who Left Its Routine &ndash; and Died</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">In 1649, Queen Christina of Sweden invited Descartes to her court in Stockholm to instruct her in philosophy. The queen insisted that lessons begin at five in the morning &ndash; in the middle of the Swedish winter, for a man who had spent his entire life working until late morning in bed. Descartes gave up his protected routine to comply with the queen's request.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">A few months later, in February 1650, he died in Stockholm of pneumonia &ndash; likely aggravated, at least in part, by the icy northern cold he exposed himself to in the early morning hours. The owl who had spent a lifetime thinking in the protected stillness of his own time abandoned that protection exactly once &ndash; and paid for it with his life. What remained was a methodical system of thought that still shapes the fundamental questions of Western philosophy today: what can I truly know? And on what can that knowledge be securely grounded?</p>

        <p class="krim-portrait-typ">SO3w4 &middot; Social Type 3 with Four-wing</p>
        <p class="krim-portrait-subtitle">Actor, 1930&ndash;2020 &ndash; Animal correspondence: Cheetah</p>
      </div>
      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Cheetah</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Cheetah</strong> is the animal of the social Three &ndash; the fastest animal on Earth, but not the loudest. Its success rests on precision, not raw force: every movement calculated, every appearance optimized for maximum effect. The cheetah stands out instantly &ndash; and that is exactly its aim.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The Scottish actor Sean Connery, born the son of a truck driver in a poor district of Edinburgh, worked as a milkman, coffin polisher, and wrestler before placing third in the Mr. Universe bodybuilding contest &ndash; and from there, within just a few years, became James Bond, the very embodiment of worldly sophistication and elegance. No other actor of his generation crossed such a distance between origin and image. The cheetah that sprints from nothing and leads the field within seconds.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Social Three: From Milkman to Global Icon</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>social Three (SO3)</strong> is the amplification type of the Three &ndash; the subtype that lives the passion of vanity to a particularly strong degree. It does not live for individual achievements, it <em>is</em> achievement &ndash; an image that must be publicly confirmed and earned again and again. Naranjo described this subtype as the one in which vanity and ambition emerge most undisguised, because the social stage itself becomes the content of life.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Connery&#39;s transformation from Scottish working-class boy to Sir Sean Connery is SO3 logic in its purest form: he took acting classes, worked on softening his broad Scottish accent, had himself coached in manners, dress, and bearing, until the former furniture mover became a man who could credibly play aristocrats. Beginning in 1962 as James Bond in <em>Dr. No</em>, he became overnight the embodiment of international elegance &ndash; an image he perfected across seven films through 1983.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The SO3 needs confirmation from an audience larger than the individual. Connery was voted &bdquo;Sexiest Man Alive&ldquo; multiple times, even past the age of sixty &ndash; proof that his image was not tied to a single role or age, but had become a cultural institution in its own right.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Four-wing: The Man Behind Bond</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Four-wing (w4)</strong> gives the social Three a depth that goes beyond pure image &ndash; the desire to be perceived as a distinct, unmistakable individual, not only as a role. This tension defined Connery&#39;s entire career: he played Bond with a precision that turned the character into an icon &ndash; and simultaneously fought throughout his life not to be reduced to it.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Publicly, Connery remained remarkably closed off. Hardly any home stories, hardly any revelations about his private life, a notoriously brief relationship with the press. The Four-wing demands authenticity &ndash; but not at the cost of control over one&#39;s own image. What he did reveal was carefully chosen: his passionate Scottish identity, his commitment to the Scottish National Party, his love of golf. Everything else stayed hidden behind the same unwavering, calm authority.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This Scottish identity was no side matter for Connery, but the authentic core beneath the international image: despite world fame and residences in Spain and the Bahamas, he remained his entire life a declared Scottish nationalist who donated millions to the independence movement. The Four-wing preserved this one place where the image and the person remained identical.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Break with Bond: Reinvention as Necessity</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">In 1971 Connery left the Bond role that had made him a global star &ndash; he did not want to be identified forever with a single figure. Years of varied, often difficult role choices followed, before he re-established himself in the 1980s as a serious character actor: as an Irish cop in <em>The Untouchables</em> (1987, Oscar for Best Supporting Actor), as an immortal warrior in <em>Highlander</em>, as the father of Indiana Jones.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This reinvention is SO3w4 logic in its clearest expression: the social Three needs continuous public affirmation &ndash; but the Four-wing refuses repetition for its own sake. An SO3 with a weaker Four-wing might have clung to the lucrative Bond brand. Connery took the risk of leaving it behind in order to be taken seriously as an independent artist &ndash; and thereby proved that his success was not tied to a single role.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Light and Shadow of the Social Three</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SO3 is its ability to create an image that becomes larger than the person &ndash; and yet to fill it with substance. Connery&#39;s Bond redefined a film genre and remained for decades the standard every successor had to be measured against. His later work proved that real acting skill stood behind the image.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The fate pattern of the Three is <strong>vanity / deception</strong> &ndash; visible in the SO3 as the necessity to constantly appear in the best light. Connery&#39;s relationship with his own past remained ambivalent: he rarely spoke openly about the poverty of his childhood or the struggles of his rise, letting the flawless facade of the global star speak for itself instead. More controversial still were public statements from the 1970s in which he downplayed physical violence in relationships &ndash; statements he never retracted, which cast a clear shadow over his image.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The Four-wing brings its own shadow pattern: a tendency to fundamentally distrust closeness, because it threatens the carefully controlled facade. Who Connery truly was, beyond Bond, beyond the Scottish patriot, often remained hidden even from close companions.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Healing Path: From Image to Substance</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The healing path of the Three leads from the question <em>How am I seen?</em> to the insight <em>I am &ndash; even without the perfect image.</em> For the SO3w4 this means no longer measuring one&#39;s own worth by whether the role still holds or whether the audience is still applauding.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Connery&#39;s withdrawal from Hollywood in the mid-2000s &ndash; voluntary, without a grand farewell, without the one last great film meant to crown the body of work &ndash; reads in retrospect like a rare, deliberate gesture: stopping before the image turns into a caricature of itself. The cheetah that, at some point, no longer runs to prove it is the fastest &ndash; but withdraws into the stillness of its own world, never fully revealed.</p>

        <p class="krim-portrait-name">T. E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia)</p>
        <p class="krim-portrait-typ">SP4w3 &middot; Self-Preservation Type 4 with Three-wing</p>
        <p class="krim-portrait-subtitle">British officer, archaeologist and writer, 1888&ndash;1935 &ndash; Animal correspondence: Dove</p>
      </div>
      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Dove</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>dove</strong> carries messages over long distances and returns, even through storms &ndash; resilient at its core, even when it looks delicate. It is not an animal of loud gestures, but one that proves itself through persistence. Thomas Edward Lawrence was born in 1888 in Tremadog, Wales &ndash; out of wedlock. His father, an Irish baronet, had left his first family to live with his daughters' governess, Sarah Junner; divorce was impossible on religious grounds, so the couple lived under the assumed name "Lawrence" and passed themselves off as married. His entire childhood thus unfolded under the sign of a carefully guarded family secret, which Lawrence only learned in full as a young adult.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This early experience &ndash; that the real truth must stay hidden behind a carefully maintained facade &ndash; is the soil in which the self-preservation Four grows. Lawrence studied history at Oxford, undertook a months-long solo walking tour through Syria as a student to research Crusader castles for his thesis, and afterward worked as an archaeologist at the excavation site of Carchemish on the Euphrates &ndash; years in which he came to know the Arabic language, the desert, and its tribes at close range, long before the war would draw him back there.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Self-Preservation Four: Tenacity as a Way to Survive</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>self-preservation Four (SP4)</strong> is the counter-type of the Four: it does not turn its suffering into dramatic self-display, but endures it &ndash; alone, with quiet harshness toward itself. Naranjo called this subtype <em>tenacity</em>. As a British liaison officer to the Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire (1916&ndash;1918), Lawrence rode for weeks through the desert, often hundreds of kilometers at a stretch, under the same harsh conditions as the Arab fighters he had joined &ndash; not an officer issuing orders from a distance, but one who physically endured hunger, exhaustion, and injury, both at the capture of Aqaba in 1917 and in countless demolition raids on the Hejaz Railway.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This tenacity showed itself even more extremely later on: from 1922, Lawrence &ndash; by then world-famous as "Lawrence of Arabia" &ndash; voluntarily gave up his officer's rank and enlisted under the false name "John Hume Ross" as an ordinary recruit in the Royal Air Force &ndash; lowest possible rank, the plainest quarters, hard physical labor. After the press exposed him, he switched to the Tank Corps, this time under the name "T. E. Shaw," before later returning to the RAF. No public protest, no explanatory appearance &ndash; only a quiet, persistent retreat into the lowest, most anonymous level of military service.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Three-wing: The Myth He Helped Create Himself</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Three-wing (w3)</strong> gives the self-preservation Four a pronounced sense for how a story lands &ndash; and the wish to make its own inner uniqueness visible. In 1918 the American journalist Lowell Thomas met Lawrence in Jerusalem and had his photographer, Harry Chase, photograph him in splendid Arab dress &ndash; images that later became among the most widely reproduced photographs of the twentieth century. Lawrence posed for them repeatedly, even in Thomas's own London garden, wearing a business suit and polished shoes underneath the robes, still visible in uncropped versions of the photographs. Thomas's multimedia show about "Lawrence of Arabia" went on to reach several million spectators in London and New York &ndash; and Lawrence himself actively helped build this myth.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Almost simultaneously with this fame came the countermovement: the retreat under a false name into the lowest ranks (see section 2). The Three-wing produced the need for the great, visible role &ndash; yet once it was achieved, the Four underneath experienced it as unbearable self-alienation. A striking parallel exists with another SP4w3 in this compass, the writer <a href="javascript:void(0)" data-route="beruehmte-honore-de-balzac">Honoré de Balzac</a>, who appropriated a noble title to which he had no claim: both men created a glamorous public image of themselves &ndash; and both carried the weight of that self-made myth for the rest of their lives, because it never quite matched what they felt inside.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. Deraa 1917: The Wound He Never Spoke of Publicly</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">In November 1917, Lawrence was captured by Ottoman troops during a reconnaissance mission in the town of Deraa, beaten, and, according to his own later written account, sexually assaulted. He almost never spoke of this event publicly &ndash; yet in his war memoir "Seven Pillars of Wisdom" he devoted an agonizingly detailed chapter to it. He nearly lost the manuscript entirely at a train station in 1919, rewrote it afterward entirely from memory, revised it fundamentally several more times in the following years, and initially had it printed only in a limited, expensive subscription edition for a few hundred subscribers, earning nothing from it himself.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">From 1923 onward, Lawrence arranged with a fellow serviceman, John Bruce, to be flogged at irregular intervals &ndash; a ritual he orchestrated himself and continued for years. Biographers agree in interpreting it as a form of self-punishment connected to the humiliation he suffered at Deraa. True to form for the self-preservation Four: the deepest pain was never shared, but processed alone, in silence, on his own body, over years.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Light and Shadow</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SP4w3 lies in its ability to turn a deeply personal, often unspeakable experience into a work of lasting literary power. "Seven Pillars of Wisdom" still ranks among the most significant war memoirs and self-testimonies of the twentieth century &ndash; precisely because Lawrence never smoothed over his own inner conflict between heroic myth and private shame, but worked through it honestly across draft after draft.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The fate pattern of the Four is <strong>envy</strong> &ndash; the deep feeling that others were effortlessly given what one lacks oneself: belonging, an untainted origin, a self-image without a fracture. The Three-wing sharpened this struggle by driving Lawrence to publicly create exactly the flawless, heroic self-image he felt least inside &ndash; and then made him suffer all the more heavily under its weight. The shadow showed in a life torn between world fame and self-chosen anonymity, between literary masterpiece and physical self-punishment, until Lawrence died on May 19, 1935 from the injuries of a motorcycle accident in Dorset &ndash; six days after swerving to avoid two cyclists on a narrow road.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Dove That Never Quite Believed Its Own Message</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">T. E. Lawrence is one of the few historical figures who became a myth within his own lifetime &ndash; and who carried precisely that burden most heavily. This is the peculiar tension of the self-preservation Four with a Three-wing: the ability to create an image the world admires, while carrying a deep, private certainty that the image never quite fits.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The dove that learned, as a child born out of wedlock, that the truth must stay hidden behind a facade &ndash; and who lived through that same experience once more as an adult, first as a self-made hero, then as an anonymous recruit under a false name &ndash; that is the lasting image of this subtype: a man who achieved greatness and yet doubted, for the rest of his life, whether he himself matched what the world saw in him.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Black Mamba</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The Black Mamba does not wear its warning color openly – from a distance it looks almost unremarkable, until it feels threatened. Then it strikes with a precision and speed that nothing can escape. Anyone who has ever glimpsed Udo Lindenberg flash out from under his hat, sunglasses, and coat knows this principle: armor behind which pure alertness hides.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The German musician Udo Lindenberg, born in 1946 in Gronau, is considered the inventor of German-language rock – a genre that simply did not exist before him, because no one believed you could sing German with such nonchalance, such irreverence, such poetry. With his Panikorchester, he wrote his way, from the early seventies onward, into a country that did not yet take its own language seriously in rock – and stayed the course, with the same consistency, for more than fifty years.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Sexual One: Fervor and the Countertype</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The sexual One (SX1) is the countertype of the One – the subtype that looks least like a moral crusader and is yet the most uncompromising of all. Naranjo called this subtype Zeal: a burning desire to separate the genuine from the false, more unfiltered and direct than in any other One subtype. Where the self-preservation One works on itself and the social One instructs the community, the sexual One carries its truth outward – loud, physical, impossible to ignore.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In 1983, Lindenberg wrote "Sonderzug nach Pankow" ("Special Train to Pankow"), a song that demonstrated exactly this: a direct, irreverent, public challenge to Erich Honecker, wrapped in swing and mockery, demanding he finally be allowed to perform in East Germany. No detour through diplomacy, no cautious maneuvering – the sexual One says what it believes is right, straight to the address of power, with a risk that most artists of his time would have avoided.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">His trademark – the ever-identical combination of hat, sunglasses, and coat – is also an expression of this fervor: a self-chosen, unshakeable form with nothing left to negotiate. Whoever meets Lindenberg meets the same uncompromising image every time – the sexual One refuses to conform, even visually.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Nine Wing: Persistence Behind the Fire</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The Nine wing (w9) adds a peculiar endurance to the intensity of the sexual One – a persistence that arises not from indifference, but from the ability to stay with something for a long time, even when no one else is paying attention anymore. Lindenberg has lived for decades in the same suite at the Hotel Atlantic in Hamburg – a constant that seems almost absurd in an artist's life full of change, and yet shows exactly the Nine-wing gravity that holds the One's fire in place.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This persistence also carried him through the quiet years, when his star seemed to be fading, until the comeback album "Stark wie zwei" (2008) and, in 2011, the ballad "Cello," re-recorded together with <a href="#beruehmte-clueso">Clueso (SX2w1)</a>, introduced him to an entirely new generation. No coincidence, but the fruit of decades of holding out without compromising his own form. As a painter of his "Likörelle" – watercolors mixed with alcohol – the same patient, almost meditative constancy shows itself alongside the loud fire of the stage.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Passion: Wrath as Moral Judgment</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The passion of the One is called wrath – and in the SX1w9 it discharges not as private bitterness, but as public, often political statement. For decades, Lindenberg positioned himself unmistakably against nuclear weapons, against right-wing extremism, against war – not as an occasional remark, but as a consistent stance he never softened, even when it earned him a performance ban in East Germany and occasional ridicule in West Germany.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This wrath is no blind outburst but a moral judgment with a clear address: injustice, hypocrisy, and violence are the triggers at which the mamba strikes. The consistency with which Lindenberg held to his positions – even when it became uncomfortable – is the clearest expression of this passion: uncompromising, but never arbitrary.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Fascination and Polarization</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">As one would expect from the sexual One, Lindenberg's impact was never half-hearted. For some, he was for decades the eccentric outsider at the fringe of the music business; for others, he was from the start a moral and musical authority. Indifference was never an option with him – people either loved the "Panikpräsident" or could make nothing of him, with little in between.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">It was precisely this unbending quality, paired with the quiet persistence of the Nine wing, that eventually made him a lasting institution – an artist who never changed course to please anyone, and who was, precisely because of that, rediscovered again and again across generations.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Gift: Stance as Art</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">What Udo Lindenberg leaves behind is more than a discography – it is proof that a once-found, uncompromising stance can carry an entire artist's life without hardening into rigidity. "Sonderzug nach Pankow" remains a lesson in how art can address power directly and without fear. His trademark of hat and sunglasses has become the collective image of an entire era of German pop culture.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The sexual One can inspire by refusing to conform – Lindenberg did exactly that, for more than fifty years, in music, painting, and political voice. That is the gift of the Black Mamba: an intensity that never pretended to be anything else, and precisely because of that, still carries today.</p>

        <p class="krim-portrait-subtitle">Politician, President of the Russian Federation, born 1952 in Leningrad &ndash; Animal correspondence: Wolf</p>
      </div>
      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Wolf</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Wolf</strong> is the animal of the Sexual Type 6 &ndash; a pack animal that asserts its position through strength and answers any threat to its territory with bared teeth. The Wolf does not trust easily. It watches for a long time before it acts, and when it acts, it does so decisively. It knows fear &ndash; and precisely for that reason it refuses to allow it.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The Russian president Vladimir Putin, born 1952 in Leningrad, today's St. Petersburg, into modest circumstances and the only surviving child of his parents after two siblings died in the war or of illness, is this Wolf. His path from KGB officer through the St. Petersburg administration to the top of the Russian state is the story of a man who learned that control over one's own environment is the only reliable answer to an uncertain world.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Fittingly, Putin recounted in his memoirs a formative childhood memory from a courtyard in Leningrad: he had cornered a rat with a stick &ndash; but instead of surrendering, the animal suddenly leapt straight at his face. For him this became a central life lesson: when cornered, never retreat, but spring forward like the rat. The rat is a fitting image for the SX6: it does not attack out of superiority but out of fear and confinement &ndash; and turns that into aggression. How deep this pattern runs is shown by another famous SX6, Watergate operative G. Gordon Liddy, who was tormented by a rat phobia as a child and later caught, cooked and ate one to conquer his fear through sheer will. Whether metaphorically, as with Putin, or literally, as with Liddy: both try to escape their own vulnerability by becoming the most dangerous factor in the room themselves.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Sexual Six: Strength as Counter-Fear</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Sexual Six (SX6)</strong> is, according to Naranjo, the <strong>counter-type</strong> of the Six &ndash; the subtype in which the passion of fear and doubt is least visible, because it is turned into its opposite. The SX6 meets its fear not with retreat but with preemptive attack. <em>If I am strong enough, if I am unpredictable enough, if I act first &ndash; then nothing can happen to me.</em> Naranjo called this subtype <em>Strength</em>: the SX6 seeks power because it knows the experience of powerlessness and has sworn never to be at its mercy again.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Putin's political style unmistakably bears the signature of this pattern. The calculated toughness in crises, the staged displays of physical strength &ndash; judo, ice hockey, riding bare-chested &ndash;, the strategic unsettling of opponents through deliberate unpredictability: all of this follows the logic of the Wolf, which secures its position not through closeness but through demonstrated invulnerability. His own experience of the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, which Putin later called <em>the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century</em>, is the biographical core of this stance: the moment the pack fell apart and the threat came from within.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The SX6's pack is small, loyal and hierarchically ordered &ndash; a tight circle of confidants, often still from KGB and St. Petersburg days, from whom unconditional loyalty is demanded and to whom protection is granted in return. Whoever breaks from this pack or is deemed a traitor is declared a threat &ndash; a pattern that runs through Putin's entire political career.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Five-Wing: Control Through Knowledge</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Five-wing (w5)</strong> gives the Sexual Six an analytical coolness that distinguishes its combative nature from pure impulsiveness. The SX6w5 does not act from affect &ndash; it observes, gathers information, weighs options, and strikes only once it has fully grasped the situation. <em>I don't just want to be strong. I want to know before I act.</em></p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Putin's entire professional formation embodies this Five-wing: 16 years in the KGB and its successor organisations, a profession whose core is the gathering, analysis and discreet exploitation of information. His public appearances are marked by a deliberate reserve, a distance that avoids closeness and preserves control over his own self-presentation. The Five-wing also explains the patient, often years-long strategic planning that precedes many of his political moves &ndash; the opposite of impulsiveness, even when the outcome may appear abrupt from the outside.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. Rise: From KGB Officer to President</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Putin's rise is a textbook case of systematic consolidation of power. After the end of his KGB career in 1991, he became an advisor to St. Petersburg mayor Anatoly Sobchak, moved to Moscow's presidential administration in 1996, became head of the domestic intelligence service FSB in 1998, and was appointed prime minister by Boris Yeltsin in 1999. On the last day of 1999, Yeltsin unexpectedly handed him the presidency. Since then &ndash; with a four-year interruption as prime minister between 2008 and 2012, during which he continued to pull the strings de facto &ndash; he has shaped Russian politics without interruption.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This continuity is itself an expression of the SX6w5 pattern: the systematic securing of one's own position against any form of uncertainty, through constitutional changes, through control of the media, through a tight network of loyal confidants in business and administration. The Wolf that leaves nothing about its territory to chance.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Light and Shadow</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SX6w5 is the ability to convey stability and capacity for action in crises. In the chaotic years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Putin's calm, controlled manner promised many Russians an end to instability &ndash; a promise that explains his early popularity and still carries part of his domestic approval today.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The core passion of the Six is <strong>fear</strong> &ndash; and the SX6's counter-reaction to it is a toughness that recognises no limit once the perceived threat becomes existential. The annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the war of aggression against Ukraine that has continued since 2022 are the darkest consequence of this pattern: the transformation of diffuse fear &ndash; of NATO enlargement, of the loss of spheres of influence, of the imagined disintegration of his own power base &ndash; into massive aggression that has proven fatal for countless people. The suppression of domestic opposition, the crackdown on independent journalism, and the imprisonment or death of critics such as Alexei Navalny show the same pattern turned inward: whoever is deemed a threat to the pack is eliminated. This is not a peripheral aspect of the personality structure &ndash; it is its shadow side in its most radical, most consequential form.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro"><em>Note: This portrait analyses a personality structure according to the Enneagram model. It explains patterns; it justifies nothing. The war of aggression against Ukraine and the suppression of political freedom in Russia are actions to be condemned in their own right, independent of any psychological framing.</em></p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Path of Healing: Safety Without Controlling Others</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The healing path of the Six leads from the question <em>How do I protect myself from the threat?</em> to the recognition <em>I do not need to control the world in order to be safe.</em> For the SX6w5 this means no longer understanding strength as dominion over others, but as an inner firmness that needs no external confirmation through submission.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This path is not publicly visible in Vladimir Putin &ndash; on the contrary, his years in office show an increasing, not a decreasing, hardening of the pattern. The portrait therefore does not end in reconciliation but in the observation that holds for every counter-type Six: as long as safety is sought only through control over others, the Wolf remains trapped in exactly the fear it is trying to fight. The way out does not lead through more power, but through the trust it has spent a lifetime learning to avoid.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Owl Who Fled the Chaos of a Family</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>owl</strong> is the animal of the self-preservation Five &ndash; a being that withdraws into its own darkness not to flee, but to be able to see clearly at all. Robert Crumb was born in 1943 in Philadelphia, into a family he himself later described as deeply dysfunctional: his mother, who suffered the aftereffects of her own abuse-marked childhood, took amphetamines and reacted with paranoid mood swings, while his parents' marriage was marked by constant conflict.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In this chaos, the young Crumb found refuge in drawing &ndash; guided and driven by his older brother Charles, who organized the siblings into veritable drawing assembly lines to produce homemade comics. Without Charles, Crumb said later, he would never have become a professional artist. The owl retreated into its own drawn universe even as a child &ndash; not out of boredom, but out of self-defense.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. Self-Preservation Five: The Castle Made of Paper</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Naranjo called the <strong>self-preservation Five (SE5)</strong> the <em>Castle</em>: one's own territory becomes a fortress that limits the world's access as much as possible. In 1968, Crumb self-published "Zap Comix #1," one of the founding works of the underground comix movement &ndash; uncompromising, uncensored, with no regard for a publisher or a mass audience. This was not a market strategy but the most consistent form of the castle: keeping complete control over one's own work rather than surrendering it to an institution.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The passion of the Five is <strong>avarice</strong> &ndash; hoarding energy, time, and control. When his 1968 image "Keep on Truckin'" became one of the most-copied images in pop culture without him profiting from its countless commercial uses, Crumb sued several companies for copyright infringement &ndash; one of the few public battles he ever deliberately sought, because it directly concerned his control over his own work.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Four-Wing: Fantasies He Despised Himself</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Four-wing (w4)</strong> gives the self-preservation Five a sense for the deeply unique, often shameful quality of his own inner experience. Crumb repeatedly described himself as a deeply neurotic person, plagued by sexual fantasies that regularly disgusted him afterward &ndash; a conflict he did not repress, but exposed raw and unfiltered in his comics, often to the horror of critics and even fellow artists.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This unsparing self-exposure also showed in his relationship with his second wife, Aline Kominsky-Crumb, whom he married in 1978: together they published autobiographical comics that laid bare the most intimate details of their marriage, their bodies, and their conflicts &ndash; a form of closeness that could only arise from the Four-wing's willingness to display one's own inner life without embellishment, while the Five core simultaneously shielded everything else strictly.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Brother Who Perished in His Own Castle</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Charles Crumb, the brother Robert owed his artistic beginnings to, developed a severe mental illness in adulthood. He rarely left his mother's house, struggled with repressed pedophiliac neuroses, and filled his notebooks with obsessively dense, concentric lines covering every free space &ndash; a castle that, unlike Robert's, never opened again. Charles took his own life at age 49 by overdose.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Robert Crumb has never concealed this loss, addressing it openly in interviews and in the documentary "Crumb" (1994) &ndash; a rare exception to the otherwise strict shielding, one that shows how deeply his family history underlies his entire body of work.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Light and Shadow of the Self-Preservation Five</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SE5w4 shows in Crumb's uncompromising graphic honesty: characters like Fritz the Cat and Mr. Natural exposed the double standards of American society and the hippie generation alike, without exempting himself. Hardly any artist has made social taboos &ndash; sex, drugs, racism &ndash; so unfiltered and visible.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The shadow lies in the price of this honesty: Crumb described himself as plagued by self-disgust, unable to endorse his own fantasies, which he nonetheless could not suppress. In 1993, the family moved from California to a remote village in southern France &ndash; among his stated reasons: "lousy schools, too much crime, suburban sprawl, media overload." The castle was chosen as an entire country, to escape American life for good.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Owl Who Withdrew to a French Village</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The healing path of the Five leads from the question <em>Do I have enough to show myself?</em> to the insight <em>What is shown does not become less valuable for being imperfect.</em> For the SE5w4, this means no longer hoarding one's own, often shame-laden inner world alone, but &ndash; as in the shared comics with Aline &ndash; understanding it as shared, connecting material.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Robert Crumb still lives today in withdrawn seclusion in southern France, far from the art world he always regarded with suspicion. The owl who, as a child, fled the chaos of his family into his own castle made of paper left behind a body of work that helped millions of readers bear their own shadow sides a little less alone &ndash; precisely because it never tried to hide its own.</p>

        <p class="krim-portrait-typ">SO1w9 &middot; Social Type 1 with Nine-wing</p>
        <p class="krim-portrait-subtitle">Philosopher and author, b. 1964 &ndash; Animal correspondence: Goose</p>
      </div>
      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The goose who explains society's mistakes to itself</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>goose</strong> is the animal of the social One &ndash; watchful, principled, incorruptible in its sense of right and order, always responsible for the community, never just for itself. Richard David Precht, born in 1964 in Solingen, became one of the best-selling nonfiction authors in the German language with "Who Am I, and If So, How Many?" (2007), and has since remained one of the most prominent public voices on questions of education, digitalization, ethics, and society.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">His body of work spans more than twenty books, his own ZDF show ("Precht"), and, since 2022, the weekly podcast "Lanz & Precht" together with television host Markus Lanz &ndash; a format that, interestingly, brings together two representatives of the same subtype, each embodying, in their own way, the same watchful responsibility for public discourse.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The social One: reform as a life's task</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>social One (SO1)</strong> takes watchful responsibility for the order of a collective &ndash; not out of a need for recognition, but from an incorruptible conviction that things must be done correctly. Precht has positioned himself for decades as a reformer of a system he considers fundamentally flawed: with "Anna, the School, and the Dear Lord" (2013), he presented a widely discussed manifesto against the existing German education system, which he criticized as outdated and no longer suited to children's lived reality.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This reformist conviction runs through his entire body of work: from criticism of factory farming to calls for an unconditional basic income to his engagement with artificial intelligence &ndash; always with the claim not merely to describe, but to correct what he sees as wrong.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Nine-wing: persuasiveness without volume</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Nine-wing (w9)</strong> gives the social One a subdued, undramatic note &ndash; the conviction remains unshakeable, but is rarely carried outward explosively. Precht's public style is marked by calm, narrative argumentation rather than loud confrontation: he persuades through the patient unfolding of a line of thought, not through provocation for its own sake.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This contrast becomes especially clear alongside his podcast partner Markus Lanz (also SO1w9): where Lanz lives out his watchful adherence to principle through meticulous fact-based confrontation in interviews, Precht expresses the same underlying disposition through the patient, narrative-philosophical unfolding of a reform idea &ndash; two very different stages for the same underlying pattern of watchful responsibility.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. Light and shadow</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SO1w9 is its ability to <strong>convey complex societal questions to a broad audience in an accessible way with a clear stance</strong> &ndash; Precht's books have brought debates about education, artificial intelligence, and the ethics of factory farming to a mass audience that academic literature alone would never have reached.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The shadow of the social One with a Nine-wing shows in how much the conviction of one's own correctness can tempt one to overreach one's actual expertise: Precht has repeatedly been criticized by subject-matter experts for oversimplifying complex issues outside his own field, or asserting them with too much certainty &ndash; for instance in debates over COVID policy or the war in Ukraine &ndash; a criticism leveled at him with remarkable persistence over the years, without him fundamentally changing his public role.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. From individual works to an institutionalized platform</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">It is telling for the social One that Precht did not leave his reformist convictions confined to individual books, but translated them over decades into ever-larger, new formats &ndash; from nonfiction to his own television show to a weekly podcast that regularly ranks among Germany's most-listened-to.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This continuous expansion of his own reach, without ever abandoning the underlying reformist claim, shows the same watchful persistence that also distinguishes Roald Amundsen or Ursula von der Leyen in this compass &ndash; only applied to the field of public discourse rather than polar exploration or politics.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The goose keeping watch in duet with a second goose</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">What sets Precht apart is the consistency with which he has held to his role as public admonisher and reform thinker for decades, regardless of whether it earned him applause or sharp expert criticism &ndash; the conviction itself remained the constant.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In the end, one image remains that fits his archetypal animal well: the goose that keeps watch together with a second goose on the "Lanz & Precht" podcast &ndash; two watchful, incorruptible voices, each in their own way, one fact-checking, the other thought-unfolding, striving toward the same order of public conversation.</p>

        <p class="krim-portrait-subtitle">Actor, painter, musician &amp; writer, born 1930 &ndash; Animal correspondence: Eagle</p>
      </div>
      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Eagle Who Ran Four Crafts at Once</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Eagle</strong> is the animal of Self-Preservation Type 1 &ndash; an animal that works with calm precision and applies its abilities with discipline, without scattering its focus. Armin Mueller-Stahl, born in 1930 in what was then Tilsit, first studied violin and musicology at the conservatory in West Berlin before finding his way to acting at the Theater am Schiffbauerdamm in 1953. "For me, painting, writing, making music and acting simply belong together" &ndash; a life motto that united four different crafts under a single, disciplined self-understanding.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">That is exactly the eagle's nature: not haphazardly sampling many talents, but consistently cultivating each craft by one's own high standards &ndash; over decades, until he was taken as seriously as a painter, graphic artist, sculptor, and writer as he was as one of the most significant German actors of his generation.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. Self-Preservation One: Fidelity to Principle as a Matter of Survival</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">According to Naranjo, the <strong>Self-Preservation One (SE1)</strong> seeks security through her own correctness and a high, often invisibly lived sense of duty toward herself. In Mueller-Stahl this showed in 1976, when he was among the signatories of the Biermann Resolution &ndash; a manifesto critical of the East German government's expatriation of the singer-songwriter Wolf Biermann. The consequence was a professional ban in East Germany, before he was permitted to emigrate to West Germany in 1980.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This step was not a spontaneous protest but the consistent continuation of an inner stance: principles were not staged for public effect, but simply followed because they were right &ndash; even at the cost of his own career in a country where he was already an established actor. That is exactly SE1 security: it lies not in outward success, but in the knowledge of having acted correctly by one's own standards.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Nine-wing: Quiet Persistence Instead of Confrontation</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Nine-wing</strong> gives the Self-Preservation One an additional calm and an aversion to loud confrontation. Mueller-Stahl was never a political megaphone &ndash; his protest consisted of a signature, not public speeches or demonstrations. Even after emigrating, he acted with restraint: rather than staging himself as a dissident icon, he quietly and persistently worked his way into a new career in West Germany under Rainer Werner Fassbinder, one that eventually took him all the way to Hollywood.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This combination of unshakeable inner principles (One) and an outwardly calm, non-confrontational presence (Nine-wing) also shaped his choice of roles: he frequently embodied restrained, morally upright characters whose strength showed not in loud assertion, but in quiet consistency.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. Four Crafts, One Standard</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">In 1997, Mueller-Stahl published his autobiography "Unterwegs nach Hause" ("On the Way Home") &ndash; yet another craft to which he devoted the same care as acting. His paintings and sculptures were shown in their own exhibitions, not as a byproduct of his film career, but as an independent body of artistic work with its own standard.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This ability to pursue several demanding disciplines in parallel at a high level, without neglecting any of them, is typical for SE1: the inner standard applies equally to every craft &ndash; there are no areas where sloppiness is tolerated just because they aren't in the spotlight.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Light and Shadow</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SE1w9 shows in Mueller-Stahl in the resilience with which he defended his principles against considerable personal loss, and in the quiet discipline with which he cultivated four different artistic crafts at the highest level for decades &ndash; without ever becoming a loud, self-promoting figure.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The shadow of the One lies in the risk of one's own high standards turning into an unforgiving inner authority that leaves little room for self-leniency. The Nine-wing acts here as a corrective: it prevented fidelity to principle from turning into self-righteousness, and kept Mueller-Stahl in a reserved, conciliatory basic stance, even toward the system that had temporarily denied him his career.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Eagle That Never Built Only One Nest</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Armin Mueller-Stahl's life's work shows the Self-Preservation One with a Nine-wing in its most productive form: fidelity to principle that does not break under pressure, paired with the quiet persistence to master several artistic crafts in parallel rather than confining himself to one. The eagle doesn't just build one nest &ndash; it commands several skies at once, each with the same precision.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Rabbit</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Rabbit</strong> is the animal of the self-preservation Six &ndash; watchful, cautious, never the first to expose itself. Stan Laurel, known as "Stanley" or simply "the dumb one" internationally, played on screen the naive, bumbling counterpart to Oliver Hardy's bloated "fat one" &ndash; confused, childlike, seemingly helpless in the face of even the simplest situation.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In real life Laurel was nearly the exact opposite of this stage persona: the actual creative mind of the duo, who wrote, revised, and directed most of their sketches himself, often deep into the night, with an unusually meticulous eye for the timing of every single gesture. The rabbit checks the situation carefully before showing itself &ndash; and Laurel checked every gag over and over until it truly landed.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. Self-Preservation Six: Security Through Control in the Familiar</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>self-preservation Six (SP6)</strong> seeks security not in a strong group or in shifting bonds, but in reliable, manageable structures of everyday life. Laurel found this structure in his more than 30-year creative partnership with Hardy &ndash; a constant he never replaced after Hardy's death in 1957: Laurel never made another film afterward, though he lived eight more years.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">His meticulous, repeated test screenings before real audiences, where he refined already well-received gags even further, show the same underlying disposition: security arises not from spontaneous inspiration but from repeated, controlled checking until no doubt remains.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Five-Wing: The Meticulous Craftsman Behind the Scenes</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Five-wing (w5)</strong> gives the self-preservation Six an additional analytical distance and a preference for quiet, technical detail work over sociable exchange. Laurel wrote, edited, and planned his sketches largely alone at his desk, often through the night, before bringing the results into the studio &ndash; an introverted, almost scientific devotion to the craft of comedy that stood in stark contrast to the public perception of his bumbling screen character.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This combination of caution (Six) and distance (Five-wing) also explains his striking self-deprecation: in later interviews and conversations with visitors, Laurel repeatedly insisted that Hardy had been "the real star," and that he himself was "just the idea man in the background" &ndash; a reflexive understatement of his own role, typical of the Six, who rarely feels fully certain of their own competence even when it is objectively indispensable.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Role: The Naive One as a Constructed Persona</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The bumbling, childishly naive Stan character was a deliberately constructed persona that showed exactly the opposite of Laurel's actual working method &ndash; a clever device that hid a highly controlled personality behind an apparently helpless figure. This exact shift is typical of the Six with a Five-wing: competence and control take place out of sight, while the public figure deliberately stays harmless.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">That such a meticulously working writer and director played precisely the role of the naive fool is not irony, but consistency: one's own control is not put on display, but preferably exercised invisibly in the background.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. The Person Behind the Persona</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Laurel's private life was more turbulent than his professional relationship with Hardy: multiple marriages, some quickly dissolved, a contrast to the decades-long reliability of his creative partnership. After retiring, he personally answered every single fan letter and received young comedians such as Dick Van Dyke or Jerry Lewis, who sought his advice &ndash; a form of dutiful, reliable accessibility to many, rather than exclusive focus on a single bond.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This broad but always controlled openness toward younger colleagues is the most mature SP6w5 signature: trust is not given away spontaneously, but built through reliable, repeated gestures &ndash; even once his own big stage career was long over.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Legacy: The Rabbit That Controlled Everything</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Stan Laurel left behind a comedic body of work whose precision is still admired by film historians today &ndash; not despite, but because of his meticulous, often anxiously exact control of every single detail. Together with Oliver Hardy (SP7w8) he formed one of the longest-lasting and most influential comedy duos in film history.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Enneagram-wise, he complements Hardy in an interesting way: where Hardy found security through the enjoyable repetition of the pleasant, Laurel sought it through the controlled, repeated checking of his own craft. The rabbit didn't need to dominate the stage &ndash; it was enough to have every detail under control before the curtain rose.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Peacock Who Designed His Own Image From the Ground Up</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>peacock</strong> does not appear by accident – every feather sits deliberately, every color expresses a carefully composed effect. Lenny Kravitz, born 1964 in New York, son of TV producer Sy Kravitz and actress Roxie Roker, reinvented himself right after high school as the stage character "Romeo Blue," before discarding it again ahead of his debut album 'Let Love Rule' (1989). A deliberate shaping and discarding of his own stage identity, long before the music itself brought lasting success.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">To this day, his style – eclectic, offbeat, instantly recognizable – is considered a statement in its own right, receiving at least as much attention as his music itself.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Sexual Three: Magnetism in the Immediate Moment</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Sexual Three (SX3)</strong>, per Naranjo, does not seek abstract social standing, but immediate, magnetic impact in the direct moment of encounter. In Kravitz this shows in a viral workout clip: he lifts weights in leather pants, a sheer shirt, boots, and sunglasses – an image that went around the world. Asked why he trains this way, he replied that he doesn't do it "for effect," but simply comes "in off the street" – a line that lays bare the SX3's typical fusion of self-image and performance: even he can barely draw the line between his real self and his staged image anymore.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">His sound works the same way – the fusion of rock, funk, soul, and psychedelia into an instantly recognizable sonic signature: impact in the moment, not classification by genre.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Two-wing: Warmth That Carries Beyond the Breakup</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Two-wing</strong> gives the sexual Three an attentive, caring note that goes beyond pure self-presentation. After divorcing Lisa Bonet, Kravitz stayed closely bonded with her – to this day he maintains a warm relationship with her, her current husband Jason Momoa, and their shared children. No rivalry, no distancing, but a continued, warm connection beyond the romantic relationship itself.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">His daughter Zoë Kravitz described him this way: "I've seen the way you show up and take care of the people you love. I've seen your incredible dedication to your art." This exact combination – devoted care for people close to him and, at the same time, uncompromising dedication to his own artistic self-presentation – is the characteristic mix of SX3 drive for impact and Two-wing warmth.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Work: From Alter Ego to Serial Grammy Winner</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">From 1999 to 2002 Kravitz won four consecutive Grammy Awards for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance – an unprecedented streak at the time. Hits like "Are You Gonna Go My Way" (1993), "Fly Away" (1998), and his cover of "American Woman" (1999) made him one of the most defining rock musicians of his generation, one who never let himself be pinned to a single genre.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In parallel, he built a second pillar with Kravitz Design Inc. – hotel projects, private residences, and collaborations with brands like Rolex, Leica, and Dom Pérignon – proof of how consistently he extended his aesthetic instinct beyond music into a brand of his own.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Light and Shadow of the Sexual Three with Two-wing</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SX3w2 shows in Kravitz in a rare combination: self-presentation that never feels cold or calculated, because it is bound up with genuine, decades-proven devotion to the people who matter to him.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The shadow of the Three lies in the blurred line between authentic self and consciously maintained image – even in the private gym, the rockstar aesthetic persists, and the insistence that it isn't done "for effect" only reveals how thoroughly image and person have already merged.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Musician Who Made Himself Into a Work of Art</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Lenny Kravitz's path shows the sexual Three with Two-wing in a particularly style-defining form: a lifelong, deliberately shaped image that was never separated from genuine warmth toward the people he loves. The peacock doesn't display its feathers out of vanity alone – it displays them because performance and affection are, for him, two sides of the same movement.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Wolf at the Chessboard</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>wolf</strong> is the animal of the Sexual Six – an animal that does not trust easily, watches for a long time before acting, and answers every threat with uncompromising hardness. Bobby Fischer, born in 1943, grew up under unstable conditions: by fourth grade he had already been in and out of six schools, and his mother Regina raised him alone while heavily engaged in political activism. When he was sixteen, she left their shared apartment for her medical training – Fischer was left alone, with the chessboard as his one reliable territory.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Even as a child, his identity fused completely with the game: after learning the rules in 1949, he spent hours at first playing against himself – his mother worried he was spending too much time alone. The wolf carves out its own, controllable territory when the world around it offers no reliable footing.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Genius at the Board: Preparation as a Weapon Against Fear</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">At just thirteen, Fischer produced what later became known as the "Game of the Century" against Donald Byrne in 1956: he sacrificed his queen to unleash an unstoppable attack – a combination still taught worldwide today. Grandmaster David Bronstein later said: "For a long time I couldn't understand why this fifteen-year-old boy played so brilliantly." This was no fluke: Fischer prepared with a thoroughness that surprised even Soviet professionals. In Moscow in 1958 he found theoretical ideas in foreign-language chess literature that local experts had overlooked; he taught himself Russian purely to read Soviet chess journals in the original that no competitor otherwise studied.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This intensity of preparation is pure SX6w5 logic: the Five-wing supplies the capacity for exhaustive, solitary mastery of knowledge others overlook; the Sexual Six turns that knowledge into a weapon against its own fear of being caught off guard or outsmarted. At his 1971 Candidates match against Mark Taimanov, Fischer found a move buried in a footnote of a Soviet monograph – a line Taimanov, himself a Sicilian expert, had missed. Fischer won 6–0. Weeks later he won 6–0 against Bent Larsen as well, then 6½–2½ against Tigran Petrosian – a twenty-game winning streak against world-class players without a single loss, a feat never matched before or since. Petrosian later said Fischer had "become a genius" after the sixth game, while he himself had "collapsed"; Garry Kasparov called this record a dominance over rivals that no one else had ever shown.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">His playing style itself was never passive or defensive but confrontational and aggressive – he sought out open, complication-rich positions that gave his opponent no quiet moment. This is the same movement that shaped his life beyond the board as well: fear is not avoided, but neutralized through total, overwhelming preparation and frontal attack before it can even become a threat.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Sexual Six: From Justified Suspicion to Global Paranoia</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Sexual Six (SX6)</strong> meets threat, according to Naranjo, not with retreat but with attack – security arises through a demonstration of strength, not through accommodation. Fischer's path began with a justified suspicion: in 1962 he accused three Soviet players at the Candidates Tournament of colluding to quickly draw their games in order to favor a fellow countryman – an accusation that later turned out to be largely accurate.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">But over the decades, this pointed, well-founded distrust grew into something far larger: Fischer became increasingly suspicious of organizers, arbiters, the entire world chess federation – and eventually generalized his distrust into open conspiracy theories and antisemitism, despite his own Jewish ancestry. This is exactly the typical trajectory of the unhealthy Sexual Six: an initially accurate vigilance that can no longer contain itself.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Five-Wing: Retreat Into a Safe Territory</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Five-wing</strong> shows up in Fischer as an obsessive, isolated deepening into chess as his own, controllable domain of knowledge. Contemporaries reported that even alongside intensive joint analysis sessions with players like Mikhail Tal, he still found additional time for his own private study – perfection through total control over his own learning environment, not through exchange.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">After his 1972 world championship triumph, he virtually vanished from public life – twenty years without official tournaments, before resurfacing only in 1992 for an unofficial rematch against Boris Spassky under international embargo. This capacity for radical withdrawal, for reducing social needs to an absolute minimum, is pure Five logic, combined with the Sexual Six's search for security in a self-chosen retreat rather than negotiating it in the social field.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Control as the Price of Playing</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Before the 1972 world championship match against Spassky in Reykjavik, Fischer's control demands showed in extreme form: he refused to travel until the prize fund was increased by an additional $125,000, argued for weeks over the venue, and had seventeen suits custom-tailored to control every detail of his public appearance himself. Unusually for a grandmaster of his era, he also trained intensively in tennis and fitness, so that his body, too, would be ready for the endurance of long games – control that extended to his own body just as much as to the outer conditions. During the match, he constantly demanded new conditions – control over the entire environment was not a side issue for him, but the very precondition for feeling safe at all.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In 1975 he ultimately gave up the world championship title entirely rather than play under FIDE conditions he could not dictate himself. No compromise, no adapting to the best possible outcome under the given circumstances – for the Sexual Six, control over one's own conditions of safety matters more than success itself.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. Light and Shadow of the Sexual Six with a Five-Wing</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SX6w5 shows in Fischer's unprecedented 11–0 result at the 1963/64 US Championship against the strongest American players of his era – a concentration and vigilance that let no weakness in his own game go unnoticed became the clearest combinatorial chess ever played. Soviet grandmaster Yuri Averbakh described him as early as 1958 as showing "astonishing poise, precise calculation, and diabolical resourcefulness" – a vigilance that translated into pure genius as long as it stayed bound to the chessboard.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro"><strong>Important note:</strong> Fischer's later public statements – Holocaust denial and open antisemitism despite his own Jewish heritage – are historically documented, morally indefensible, and are not relativized here. They show the shadow side of the unhealthy Sexual Six in its most extreme form: an originally justified distrust that detaches from its concrete original cause and generalizes into an all-explaining, dehumanizing worldview.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">7. The Wolf Who Lost His Own Pack</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Bobby Fischer died in 2008, completely isolated, in Reykjavik, Iceland, where he had finally found exile after an arrest in Japan and a travel ban from the United States. The boy who as a child found his sense of security only in the chessboard ended up as a man who, quite literally, could no longer find a country he trusted.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">And yet, independent of everything that came after: Fischer's pure chess achievement – the twenty-game winning streak without a single loss against the strongest players of his era, the never-repeated 11–0 of 1963/64, the 1972 world title he won single-handedly against the closed ranks of the Soviet chess school – still stands today as one of the greatest individual achievements in the history of sport. This is not a contradiction of everything said above but inseparable from it: the same uncompromising, fearless vigilance that ultimately drove him into isolation and delusion was exactly the force that had earlier made him, arguably, the greatest chess player who ever lived.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">A comparison within the same subtype in this compass: <a href="javascript:void(0)" data-route="beruehmte-wladimir-putin">Wladimir Putin</a> (SX6w5) shows the same underlying pattern – security through control over one's environment rather than through trust – only lived out through the power apparatus of a state rather than at the chessboard.

        <p class="krim-portrait-subtitle">CEO of Apple, born 1960 – Animal correspondence: Eagle</p>
      </div>
      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Eagle Who Called the Factory Himself at Three in the Morning</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>eagle</strong> is the animal of the Self-Preservation One: no eye on the stage, but on the post itself. Tim Cook, born in 1960 in Mobile, Alabama, joined Apple in 1998 as head of worldwide operations – at a time when the company was nearly collapsing under a chaotic, expensive supply chain. Colleagues still tell the story that Cook ended a crisis meeting with the words "This is a serious problem, someone should go to China" – and, after everyone nodded, stood up himself, drove to the airport, and did not come back until the problem was solved.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The eagle does not delegate what it can be responsible for itself. Within a few years, Cook rebuilt Apple's supply chain so radically that it became the most efficient in the technology industry – not through spectacular announcements, but through meticulous, often invisible detail work on inventory levels, supplier contracts, and manufacturing processes.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Self-Preservation One: Responsibility as Quiet Discipline</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Self-Preservation One (SE1)</strong> carries its perfectionism not outward, but inward. Naranjo called this subtype <em>Worry</em>: the constant inner question of whether one truly lives up to the task. Cook is known for rising daily at 3:45 a.m., answering emails before sunrise, and routinely being the first in the office and the last to leave – a routine he has kept practically unchanged for decades.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">When he took over from Steve Jobs in 2011, he assumed one of the largest public responsibilities in business history – not out of ambition to outdo Jobs, but with the quiet conviction that he had to live up to what the company and its employees deserved. In interviews he still repeats, matter-of-factly, that he does not think in terms of legacy but in terms of the next task in front of him.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Nine-Wing: Balance Instead of Confrontation</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Nine-wing</strong> gives the Self-Preservation One something that is hardly there on its own when the Nine-wing is weakly expressed: a basic reserve that avoids conflict and lets one's own person step back behind the matter at hand. Cook is known as strikingly introverted and, unlike his predecessor, avoids public confrontation or showmanship for its own sake – his keynote appearances are matter-of-fact, calm, almost understated.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In 2014 he came out as gay publicly – not as a loud statement, but in a calm, matter-of-fact essay in which he wrote that he had never treated his sexuality as a secret, but wanted to help people who felt alone. The same wing shows in how he has traditionally mediated internal conflicts between executives rather than letting them escalate – balance as his preferred tool, not confrontation.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Passion: Anger as Inward Accounting</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The passion of the One is called <strong>anger</strong> – in the SE1w9 it turns not outward, but inward: as an unrelenting standard applied to one's own thoroughness. Cook is known internally as a numbers person who personally works through every detail of a supply chain or a quarterly report before making a decision – he tolerates errors in his own preparation far less than criticism from outside.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Publicly, this inward-turned anger shows as moral consequence rather than volume: in 2016, under his leadership, Apple refused the FBI's request to unlock an iPhone despite massive political pressure – a position Cook justified calmly but unyieldingly in an open letter to customers, without escalating the conflict publicly.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. The Crisis as a Mirror: Leading a Company Without Its Founder</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The SE1w9 has a weak spot: it can seem sober and pale in moments that call for charismatic vision. When Cook officially became CEO in 2011, weeks before Steve Jobs' death, many analysts predicted Apple would stagnate without its visionary founder. Cook responded not with loud self-promotion, but with quiet continuity: he held to Apple's existing core principles while simultaneously building new business areas – services, wearables, in-house chips – with the same methodical patience he had earlier applied to fixing the supply chain.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">From an Enneagram perspective, this is not a weakness but the pattern's logic at work: where Jobs led with vision, Cook leads with reliability. Under his leadership, Apple became the first trillion-dollar company in history in 2018 – a result built not on a single visionary leap, but on years of meticulous operational discipline.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Legacy: Leadership Without the Need to Stand at the Center</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Tim Cook remains the CEO who proved that a global corporation need not be carried by a single charismatic figure to keep growing. His legacy lies not in one revolutionary product, but in the quiet, decades-long operational excellence that made Apple the world's most valuable company.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This is the Self-Preservation One with a Nine-wing at its purest: no need to stand at the center, but the quiet, daily question of whether one has lived up to one's own task – and the willingness to face that task again every morning at 3:45 a.m.</p>
