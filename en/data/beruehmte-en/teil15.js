        <p class="krim-portrait-subtitle">Aviation pioneer, 1897–1937 (disappeared) – Animal correspondence: Buffalo</p>
      </div>
      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Buffalo</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The buffalo is the animal of the social Nine – an animal that stands out not through individual flamboyance, but through its belonging to the herd and its calm, unhurried presence within it. Amelia Earhart, born in Kansas in 1897, became famous in 1932 as the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic – and yet her real project was never personal thrill, but proving that women could fly just as men could.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In 1937 she disappeared over the Pacific while attempting to circle the globe along the equator – her plane was never found. To this day her disappearance remains one of the most famous unsolved mysteries in aviation history.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The social Nine: Merging with a cause</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">According to Naranjo, the social Nine (SO9) is the subtype that does not settle into personal comfort, but dissolves into belonging to a group, a movement, a shared cause – the self steps back so the cause can grow. Earhart founded the "Ninety-Nines", an organization for women pilots, turning her own flying success into a collective project for every woman who followed her.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This is the crucial difference from the often-repeated "Seven" attribution: it was not personal thrill that drove her, but merging with a cause bigger than herself. Where a Seven seeks variety of experience for herself, the social Nine disappears in service of the shared cause – visible as a figurehead, but never internally fixated on herself.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The One wing: Principle without self-display</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">An SO9 with a more muted One wing might have drifted without a clear inner compass. In Earhart's case, a quiet, principled seriousness emerged instead: she insisted on keeping her own name, refused to be called "Mrs. Putnam", and in a letter to her husband-to-be George Putnam before their 1931 wedding laid out clear terms – not a dramatic gesture, but a calm, unambiguous setting of boundaries.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Her husband Putnam ran an intense publicity machine around her – interviews, lecture tours, book deals. Earhart let it happen, yet remained noticeably reserved and unhurried in her own manner. The One wing supplies exactly this sobriety: no need for self-display, but an inner standard everything else aligns to.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. "Adventure is worthwhile in itself": Distance instead of enthusiasm</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Earhart's best-known line – "Adventure is worthwhile in itself" – sounds at first like Seven enthusiasm. But the tone in which she spoke about her flights was rarely euphoric or eager to tell a story in the Seven sense. Contemporaries described her as calm, almost philosophically detached – a woman who spoke about enormous risks with the same equanimity as everyday matters.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This same sobriety extended to her relationship: in her letter to Putnam she wrote that she would not hold him to a "medieval code of faithfulness", any more than she would consider herself bound to him in the same way – a remarkably clear, unruffled stance on marriage that sought neither drama nor rebellion, but simply named reality without illusion.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Merging with the unknown</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">In 1937, Earhart set out with navigator Fred Noonan on her final major project: circling the globe along the equator, the longest flight of its kind attempted up to that point. Over the central Pacific, en route to the tiny Howland Island, radio contact broke off. Neither the aircraft nor the crew were ever found.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This final chapter, too, fits the social Nine's pattern: not a spectacular solo stunt, but the consistent continuation of a cause bigger than her own safety. She disappeared not in a reckless stunt, but in the middle of a carefully planned project serving something larger than herself.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Buffalo that disappeared into the herd</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Amelia Earhart shows the social Nine with a One wing in its most impressive form: world-famous, without ever seeming self-promoting; adventurous, without personal thrill being the actual driver; principled, without being loud. Her androgynous, hard-to-categorize appearance fits the same picture – no pronounced, unmistakable self-presentation, but a deliberate stepping back of her own outline in favor of the cause.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The buffalo does not seek independence away from the herd – it finds its strength in belonging. Earhart's legacy lies not in a loud personal myth, but in the quiet fact that after her, thousands of women sat in cockpits who otherwise never would have.</p>

        <p class="krim-portrait-name">Astrid Lindgren</p>
        <p class="krim-portrait-typ">SP1w9 &middot; Self-Preservation Type 1 with Nine-wing</p>
        <p class="krim-portrait-subtitle">Author, 1907&ndash;2002 &ndash; Animal correspondence: Eagle</p>
      </div>
      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Eagle</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Eagle</strong> is the animal of the self-preservation One &ndash; it circles high above the fray, sees with unusual clarity what unfolds below, and intervenes only when it truly matters. Not an animal of loud gestures, but of quiet, incorruptible precision. And when it spreads its wings, it carries further than almost any other creature.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Astrid Lindgren, born in 1907 on the Näs farm near Vimmerby in the Swedish province of Småland, became the most-read Swedish author of all time &ndash; over 165 million books sold, translated into more than 100 languages. And yet she remained remarkably reserved her whole life, almost invisible behind her own work. The Eagle need not circle constantly to be seen. It need only fly correctly once.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Self-Preservation One: Discipline as Daily Ritual</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>self-preservation One (SP1)</strong> directs its perfectionism not toward correcting the world, but inward: toward its own work discipline, its own precision, an incorruptible reliability toward itself. Naranjo called this subtype <em>Worry</em> &ndash; concern. The SP1 asks itself relentlessly: Did I truly do this right? Does it meet my own standard?</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In Lindgren this showed in an almost monastic work routine she maintained for decades: she wrote her first drafts in bed, in shorthand, every morning before the actual working day began &ndash; only afterward did she type the text fair on her typewriter. Alongside this, she worked for almost forty years as chief editor for children's books at the publisher Rabén &amp; Sjögren, examining others' manuscripts with the same precision she applied to her own texts. Two parallel careers, conducted with the same relentless care &ndash; not out of ambition, but from the inner demand to do it right.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Nine-Wing: Restraint Despite World Fame</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Nine-wing (w9)</strong> adds a quality to the SP1 energy that rarely survives the spotlight: the ability to step back, to merge, to put the cause rather than one's own person at the center. Where a One with a weaker Nine wing defends its position, a strongly developed Nine-wing seeks quiet impact over loud performance.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Despite her immense worldwide fame, Lindgren remained conspicuously modest throughout her life. She rarely gave detailed interviews about her private life, avoided the grand stage of her own celebrity, and lived into old age in her unpretentious Stockholm apartment on Dalagatan, reachable for neighborhood children who actually rang her doorbell to meet "the real Pippi author." The Nine-wing also shows in her publishing work: over decades she discovered and nurtured numerous other Swedish children's authors without placing herself in the foreground &ndash; a quiet, patient form of influence that is not measured by its own visibility.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Work: A Century of Childhood</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">In 1941, while sitting at the bedside of her ailing daughter Karin, Lindgren invented, at her daughter's request, the character of <em>Pippi Longstocking</em> &ndash; a girl who lives alone in a villa, is superhumanly strong, and cares nothing for adult rules. Published in 1945, the character became a literary revolution: for the first time, a child stood at the center who tolerated no authority over herself, but shaped her own life with sovereignty, kindness, and complete independence. Some contemporary educators were horrified. Millions of children were delighted.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">A body of work of rare breadth followed: <em>Karlsson on the Roof</em> (1955), <em>Emil of Lönneberga</em> (1963), the tender, melancholic <em>The Brothers Lionheart</em> (1973), still considered one of the most important children's books about death and courage, and <em>Ronia, the Robber's Daughter</em> (1981), which shaped an entire generation of Scandinavian girls. Nearly all her books combine the same rare quality: unconditional respect for childhood autonomy alongside a clear, almost strict moral order in the background &ndash; the One and her freedom-loving counterpart united in a single author.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. The Early Wound: The Son She Had to Give Up</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">In 1926, at eighteen, the unmarried Astrid became pregnant &ndash; a social scandal in the Swedish provinces of that era that could have destroyed her future there. She went to Copenhagen, secretly gave birth to her son Lasse, and, unable to support him alone, had to leave him with a Danish foster family for years &ndash; a parting she later described as the most painful moment of her life. Only in 1930, after building an independent existence for herself in Stockholm, could she bring him to live with her.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This early trauma is never directly addressed in her works &ndash; typical of the reserved SP1w9, who rarely negotiates private pain in public. Yet the recurring motif of the courageous child managing alone throughout her entire body of work, from Pippi to the Brothers Lionheart, is hardly separable from this early experience of separation and the desperate need to believe that a child can endure even without protective adults.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Righteous Anger: Pomperipossa and the Lex Lindgren</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">In 1976, the otherwise politically reserved Lindgren published the satirical tale <em>Pomperipossa in Monismania</em>, publicly revealing that as a small business owner she was required to pay over 100 percent of her income in taxes under an absurd regulation &ndash; more than she even earned. The story sparked a nationwide debate and is still considered one of the factors that contributed to the Social Democrats, who had governed for 44 years, losing power in that year's election &ndash; even though Lindgren herself had long been sympathetic to them. The One does not defend her own party, but what she believes to be right, even when it harms her own allies.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Even more decisive was her decades-long commitment to animal welfare: in her final years, the octogenarian Lindgren fought publicly and tirelessly against the conditions of industrial animal farming in Sweden. In 1988, just a year before she withdrew from public life, a new Swedish animal welfare law was passed as a direct result of her advocacy &ndash; still popularly known as the "Lex Lindgren" today. The Eagle that had spent its whole life observing precisely what was wrong &ndash; and that, at the very end of its strength, gave everything once more to change it.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">7. Light and Shadow of the Self-Preservation One</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SP1w9 is a rare combination of incorruptible integrity and quiet, sustaining kindness. Lindgren fought for justice with the same discipline she applied to reviewing manuscripts &ndash; quietly, but with enormous impact. She never tried to appear greater than she was, and precisely because of that became one of the most influential moral voices of her country.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The shadow shows in the harshness with which the SP1 holds to its own standards, and in the distance the Nine-wing favors. The early separation from her son Lasse remained a lifelong, barely processed pain that she almost never spoke about publicly &ndash; an example of how the SP1w9 carries even the deepest wounds silently within, rather than sharing them. The fate pattern of the One is <strong>anger</strong>, which in the SP1 usually turns inward &ndash; as a constant, self-imposed strictness that anything less than complete discipline does justice to no one, including oneself.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">8. The Path of Healing: From the Judge to Kindness</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The healing path of the One leads from anger to serenity &ndash; from the question <em>Did I do everything right?</em> to the recognition <em>I gave what I had, and something good grew from it.</em> In Lindgren this path shows in the development of her own work: from the untamed Pippi through the darker, death-facing tones of the Brothers Lionheart to the mature, reconciled wisdom of her public animal-welfare advocacy in old age.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Astrid Lindgren died in 2002 at the age of 94 in Stockholm, mourned by an entire nation &ndash; her funeral was broadcast live on Swedish television. She left behind no legacy of vanity, but a century's worth of children who learned through her books that one can be brave, independent, and kind, even when the adult world demands otherwise. The Eagle that never needed to be loud to carry far &ndash; and whose wingbeat still echoes today, generations later, in every child who hears of Pippi Longstocking for the first time.</p>

        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Golden Retriever</strong> is the animal of the social Two &ndash; an animal that grows up within a family and learns from an early age to entertain an audience. Bruno Mars was already performing on stage with his family band in Waikiki as a child, long before he became a solo world star &ndash; entertainment was never a goal to reach for him, but an environment he had always been at home in.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Peter Gene Hernandez was born on October 8, 1985, in Honolulu, Hawaii, the son of a half Puerto Rican, half Jewish father from Brooklyn and a Filipino mother. In 1991, at just six years old, he appeared on The Arsenio Hall Show as an Elvis Presley impersonator &ndash; early proof of how much his sense of self was tied from the start to an audience he wanted to entertain.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Social Two: Writing Hits for Others Before His Own Fame</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Naranjo called the <strong>social Two (SO2)</strong> <em>Ambition</em>: it doesn't just want to shine itself, but to become visible through its impact on others. Before Bruno Mars became known as a solo artist, he was a key songwriter behind hits for other performers, including <em>Nothin' on You</em> by B.o.B and <em>Billionaire</em> by Travie McCoy &ndash; successes whose visibility belonged to others first, before they became the springboard for his own career.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This willingness to put his own creative contribution in service of other people's careers first is the social Two in one of its most concrete forms: impact doesn't necessarily come from one's own stage, but from what one makes possible for others &ndash; before that eventually becomes one's own stage.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Three-Wing: Perfection as Stagecraft</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Three-wing (w3)</strong> gives the social Two the drive to turn talent into a flawlessly staged, visible product. Mars is considered one of the most elaborate live performers of his generation: choreographed dance routines, meticulously recreated retro aesthetics, and an album like <em>24K Magic</em> (2016), which deliberately revived the sound and look of 1990s R&B.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">With Anderson .Paak, he formed the duo Silk Sonic and released the joint album <em>An Evening with Silk Sonic</em> in 2021, featuring the hit <em>Leave the Door Open</em> &ndash; a project deliberately designed as a shared stage between two equal artists, rather than a vehicle for a single star. The Three-wing ensures that perfection never remains an end in itself, but always aims at maximum impact on the audience.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. Light and Shadow of the Social Two</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SO2w3 lies in the ability to put creative energy in service of others so naturally that it produces shared success rather than competition &ndash; visible in his willingness to build a genuine, equal partnership with Anderson .Paak instead of a solo project.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The fate pattern of the Two is <strong>pride</strong> &ndash; the conviction of being indispensable to the success of the performance. In the SO2w3, this can combine with an extraordinarily high standard of perfection for one's own stage presence that leaves little room for imperfection &ndash; a drive that produces outstanding live performances but rarely pauses.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. The Work: From Elvis Impersonator to World Star in His Own Right</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">From his first performances in the family band through years as an in-demand songwriter for other artists to his own number-one albums and the celebrated Silk Sonic project, a single thread runs through Mars' career: entertainment that is never only about himself, but always oriented toward the audience and, wherever possible, toward shared stages with others.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The Golden Retriever doesn't perform to dominate, but because the show deserves to be perfect. Bruno Mars' path from six-year-old Elvis impersonator to multiple Grammy winner carries this drive through to its logical conclusion: talent that belonged to the audience from the start, long before it belonged to his own name.</p>

SE3 does not ask <em>How am I seen?</em> but <em>What can I actually do?</em> At fifteen, Cheyenne appeared on a magazine cover for the first time; six months later, she moved to Paris alone &ndash; an early, independent departure that was, at first, entirely oriented toward visibility.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The break came with the move to Styria: in 2019, she met farmer and trained meat sommelier Nino Sifkovits on a double date in Berlin, moved to his hometown of Dobl a year later, and married him in 2022. The two now run the Chianinahof together, with more than sixty Chianina cattle, sixty fattening pigs, and around seventy sheep &ndash; direct marketing of meat instead of media self-presentation. "We are real farmers," she stated plainly in one interview &ndash; an explicit break from her earlier it-girl image that captures the SE3 principle exactly: worth is no longer claimed, but proven through concrete work.</p>

        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Four-wing (w4)</strong> gives the self-preservation Three a question that goes beyond mere competence: <em>What does my path mean &ndash; beyond what is expected of me?</em> Telling already is her choice of cattle breed: Chianina cattle are not interchangeable commodity stock, but a rare, very specific Italian breed &ndash; an aesthetic, individual choice even within a deliberately pragmatic field.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Her deliberate retreat from the glaring world of modeling into a very withdrawn, rural family life, now with two children, carries the same signature: not withdrawal out of exhaustion, but an active search for a life that feels inwardly true and singular, rather than merely functioning outwardly. In parallel, she is training to become a certified agricultural technician &ndash; formal, provable competence rather than a mere image of rural life.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. A Parallel Within This Compass: Substance That Precedes Visibility</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Cheyenne's path fits strikingly into a pattern already visible elsewhere among this compass's SE3w4 portraits. Dr. Annika von Mutius, founder of the HR-tech startup Empion, spent years deliberately building "the actual technical substance … rather than relying on loud marketing" &ndash; with the result that attention followed the substance, not the other way around. Kathrin Bauerfeind is described in this compass in almost identical terms: "No loud entrance, no glamour, no stage … the raccoon doesn't dig for the spotlight &ndash; it builds its own territory."</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Cheyenne Ochsenknecht shows exactly this movement, only in reverse order: she did not start out in obscurity and stay there &ndash; she deliberately left an already-achieved media visibility behind to build her own, concrete territory instead: her own farm, her own craft, her own cattle breed. Where von Mutius and Bauerfeind never entered the spotlight in the first place, Cheyenne's fingerprint is one of a conscious reversal: visibility first, then the active shift toward substance &ndash; another, independent path on which the same raccoon energy arrives at the same destination.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Light and Shadow of Self-Preservation Three</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of SE3w4 is the ability to leave an already-achieved, publicly visible life behind without bitterness, and to build something entirely one's own and tangible instead &ndash; married at twenty-two, twice a mother by twenty-four, and co-operator of her own farm. This is not evasion, but a very concrete, very young form of independence.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The fate pattern of the Three is <strong>self-deceit</strong> &ndash; the conviction that one's own image is identical to one's own worth. In SE3w4, this tends to show up in reverse compared to SO3 or SX3: the danger lies in letting the new, "authentic" rural-life image become just as much of a facade as the modeling image once was &ndash; a new form of self-staging under the guise of groundedness. The ongoing, publicly known estrangement between her father, Uwe Ochsenknecht, and Cheyenne also shows that even this deliberately chosen, quieter path does not automatically heal the Ochsenknecht family's underlying rifts.</p>

        <p class="vb-intro" style="font-style:italic; opacity:0.75; margin-bottom:1.5rem;">David L. Rathmer is not a celebrity in the usual sense - but he is the co-developer of this compass, founder of the Rathmer profiling method and son of the author. A portrait in your own work.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Raccoon Who Works in the Light</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The raccoon is the animal of the self-preservation Three smart, adaptable, with nimble paws and a sharp eye for what is worthwhile. When the raccoon lives consciously, he uses his extraordinary intelligence not for the night but for the light. He reads situations precisely, acts efficiently, and creates something useful out of what is available. He sees what others overlook. He opens what others cannot open.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">David L. Rathmer, born in 2003 in Münster, is one of those rare raccoons who awakened early. Introduced to the world of the Enneagram at eight years old by his father, the alternative practitioner and Enneagram expert Detlef Rathmer, he did not simply develop an interest he made it a science. What began with a child looking at photos of people and asking, "What type is that?", became over fifteen years of empirical research and ultimately an independent method that is used internationally today.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. SE3: The Countertype of the Three – Modesty as an Attitude</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The self-preservation Three (SE3) is the countertype of the Three: the subtype that hides its ambition behind modesty not as a deception, but because security is more important to it than shine. The SE3 does not seek a big stage. It seeks efficiency. It seeks what is right, what is functional, what is substantial and finds its value not in applause, but in results.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In David, this manifests as a striking calmness for his age. He does not perform to impress. He shows what he can do and that is enough for him. In advisory talks, in training sessions, in working with executives and companies that utilize his expertise in HR and personnel management: everywhere he appears grounded, focused, clear. No need for recognition. No staging. Just the craft.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">At twenty years old, he was appointed the youngest economic senator in the history of the European Economic Senate not because he had applied, but because his work convinced them. That is the SE3 in its conscious form: success as a consequence, not as a goal.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Four Wing: Depth Behind Efficiency</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The Four wing (w4) is what distinguishes David L. Rathmer from a pure efficiency technician. The Four seeks depth, authenticity, the core of things. It cannot remain on the surface it must know what is truly behind it. In an SE3w4, this connects with the practical intelligence of the Three: Depth does not become an end in itself, but a tool. What is deeply understood can be deployed with precision.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Precisely that is the key to the Rathmer Profiling Method (RP Method): David can precisely type people according to the Enneagram based solely on portrait photos and physical features. This ability is not intuitive guessing it is the result of over fifteen years of observational research, systematically structured and empirically validated. The Four wing taught him to look closely. The self-preservation Three made a method out of it.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Ennea Scholars Academy: Knowledge in Application</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The Ennea Scholars Academy, which David L. Rathmer founded, is the institutional expression of his SE3w4 energy: a company that does not store knowledge, but transfers it. Participants from all over the world learn "people reading" there the ability to precisely understand people through the Enneagram, a tool used in leadership, personnel selection, communication, and therapy.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The SE3w4 builds no cathedrals for himself. He builds systems that function without him. That is the conscious expression of the self-preservation Three: not creating dependency, but passing on competence. What David can pass on is the result of a childhood and youth completely dedicated to the Enneagram not as a sacrifice, but as a calling.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Energetic Effect: Silent Clarity</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Anyone who experiences David L. Rathmer in his work encounters an energy that is calm yet fully present. No overwhelming energy, no fireworks of charisma but the concentrated clarity of a person who knows what he sees and why. The gaze of the SE3w4 is targeted and simultaneously open: He observes without judging analyzes without distancing.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The Four wing brings a warmth with it that Threes with a less developed Four wing often lack: David is interested in the person behind the type. For him, typing is not an end, but a beginning the start of a conversation about what someone needs to truly be themselves. That is the raccoon in the light: skillful, precise, and with the dignity of genuine contact.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Gift: A Legacy That Continues to Be Built</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">At 23 years old, David L. Rathmer is at an age when most people are just beginning to understand what they want to spend their lives doing. He has known it for fifteen years. That is neither coincidence nor mere talent it is the result of a rare combination: an early environment that enables depth, a personality structure that connects efficiency with purpose, and an inner drive that needs no external validation to keep going.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">What he has given to the Enneagram is the bridge into the digital age and into entrepreneurship. What the work of Detlef Rathmer built in depth, David carries into breadth. Father and son two people who together cover the whole: the root and the growth.</p>

        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Golden Retriever</strong> is the animal of the social Two &ndash; an animal that would rather use its own talent to make someone else's talent shine. Andre Romell Young grew up in modest circumstances in Compton, California; his parents separated when he was seven, and he witnessed domestic violence within the family &ndash; an early contrast to the role of the ordering, nurturing architect he would later take on.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Dr. Dre was born on February 18, 1965, the son of two singers, which explains his early access to music. Rather than seeking the spotlight for himself as often as possible, he discovered his gift for producing at a young age &ndash; for shaping other people's talent into something larger than it could ever have become alone.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Social Two: Ambition as Architect of Other People's Careers</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Naranjo called the <strong>social Two (SO2)</strong> <em>Ambition</em>: it doesn't just want to have an effect itself, it wants to become indispensable through what it makes visible in others. As co-founder and lead producer of N.W.A., Dr. Dre shaped the sound of gangsta rap with the album <em>Straight Outta Compton</em> (1988), carrying an entire genre to a worldwide audience &ndash; yet even here he stepped back behind the collective as producer, not forward as a solo act.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This pattern continued across decades: he discovered and shaped the careers of Snoop Dogg, whom he first introduced to a mass audience on his own solo debut <em>The Chronic</em> (1992); of Eminem (SX1w2), whom he signed to his newly founded label Aftermath Entertainment in 1998; of 50 Cent (SE7w8), whose breakthrough he engineered in 2002; and later of Kendrick Lamar (SO2w3). The social Two doesn't locate its worth in standing at the center itself, but in the fact that without it, others would never have become as great.</p>

        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Three-wing (w3)</strong> gives the social Two the drive to turn musical instinct into a visible, measurable empire. In 1992, Dr. Dre co-founded Death Row Records with Suge Knight; in 1996, he left the label and built Aftermath Entertainment, an even more successful platform of his own &ndash; a pattern of constant entrepreneurial reinvention that went far beyond the role of producer alone.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In 2006, he co-founded the headphone and speaker company Beats Electronics with Jimmy Iovine, which sold to Apple in 2014 for roughly three billion US dollars &ndash; one of the largest deals in music industry history. The Three-wing translates a musical ear into entrepreneurial success that reaches far beyond individual albums and reshapes entire industries.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. Light and Shadow of the Social Two</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SO2w3 lies in the rare ability to keep a feel, across decades, for which talent is just ready to be discovered &ndash; and then to consistently build that talent a stage larger than his own. Hardly any other producer in pop music history has decisively shaped so many different careers across so many decades.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The fate pattern of the Two is <strong>pride</strong> &ndash; the conviction of being indispensable to the success of others. In the SO2w3, this can combine with the risk of measuring one's own success primarily by the success of the artists one has championed, rather than claiming credit for it &ndash; a drive that makes entire careers possible while itself often staying in the background.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. The Work: From Compton Producer to Architect of Modern Hip-Hop</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">From N.W.A. through Death Row Records and Aftermath Entertainment to Beats Electronics, a single thread runs through Dr. Dre's work: recognizing talent, giving it a structure in which it can grow, and consistently choosing the role of architect over that of solo performer.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The Golden Retriever doesn't pour its energy into its own show, but into what it makes possible for others. Dr. Dre's path from producing a single, controversial album to co-shaping several generations of artists and becoming a billionaire through a headphone company shows this drive in its most consistent form: success measured above all by how much it unlocks in others.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Hippopotamus</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Hippopotamus</strong> is the animal of the self-preservation Two &ndash; an animal that does not run because it is being hunted, but because it knows what is at stake. When it moves, it moves with its full body, without detour, without hesitation &ndash; and afterward returns to its own waters, rather than lingering permanently on foreign ground.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The German actress Franka Potente became the embodiment of exactly this energy in 1998 with <em>Run Lola Run</em>: across three replayed scenarios, she runs through Berlin for almost the entire film to save a relationship, a life &ndash; not an aimless flight, but a race against time in service of another person. This role became emblematic of her career: high intensity, full physical commitment, always in service of something larger than her own visibility.</p>

        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>self-preservation Two (SP2)</strong> directs its care first toward the close, familiar circle &ndash; toward specific people and projects it feels connected to, rather than toward the wider public. Naranjo called this subtype <em>Me First</em>: not out of selfishness, but because the SP2 operates from a secure, personally meaningful foundation, rather than expending itself on an anonymous audience.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In Potente this shows in her consistent return, after her international breakthrough, to smaller, personally meaningful German and European productions, rather than fully pursuing the obvious Hollywood path. She chose projects based on personal relevance rather than reach &ndash; a clear SP2 pattern: connection over broad impact.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The One-Wing: Uncompromising Artistic Integrity</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>One-wing (w1)</strong> gives the self-preservation Two an inner set of standards that holds independent of external validation &ndash; a clear sense of right and wrong that forces uncomfortable decisions when principle demands it. It turns care into a stance.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Potente has repeatedly spoken bluntly about sexism and unfair working conditions in the film industry &ndash; publicly, directly, without diplomatic softening. Her path beyond acting, as a writer, director, and musician under her own name, never reads as strategic image-building, but as the need to express different truths in whichever form fits them. The One-wing demands that the work be right &ndash; not that it pleases.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Work: Between World Cinema and Her Own Voice</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro"><em>Run Lola Run</em> (1998) made Potente internationally known overnight and opened her path to Hollywood, including the Bourne series as Marie Kreutz, one of the few emotionally complex female characters in the action genre of that era. Alongside this, she remained loyal to German and European auteur cinema and increasingly took on writing and directing herself.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">As a musician she has released albums under her own name containing personal, unpretentious songs far from any star staging. This versatility is not a status symbol, but an expression of the same underlying stance: finding different forms for different truths, rather than settling on one successful formula.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Light and Shadow of the Self-Preservation Two</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SP2w1 is the ability to combine care and integrity &ndash; to commit to people and projects without betraying one's own principles in the process. Potente's refusal to fully submit to the Hollywood system, and her clear public stance on the industry's failings, show this mature form of SP2 energy.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The fate pattern of the Two is <strong>pride</strong> &ndash; the conviction of being indispensable through one's own stance and care. The One-wing can turn this pride into moral strictness: the risk of making one's own integrity the standard for others, with little patience for the compromises that are often unavoidable in the film business. Potente's reputation as a demanding, sometimes difficult colleague can be read as exactly this other side of the same pattern.</p>

        <p class="krim-portrait-name">Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel</p>
        <p class="krim-portrait-typ">SO5w6 &middot; Social Type 5 with Six-wing</p>
        <p class="krim-portrait-subtitle">German philosopher, 1770&ndash;1831 &ndash; Animal correspondence: Octopus</p>
      </div>
      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Octopus That Wanted to Encompass All of Reality</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>octopus</strong> is the animal of the social Five &ndash; intelligent, many-armed, able to grasp everything around it and translate it into a single, ordered whole. Hegel needed an unusually long time before he could unfold this whole in public: after studying at the Tübingen Stift, he worked for years as a private tutor and newspaper editor before finally receiving his first regular professorship in Heidelberg in 1816, at the age of 46 &ndash; a late academic debut for his era, preceded by a long phase of quiet, withdrawn system-building.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">He completed his first major work, the "Phenomenology of Spirit," in 1806 in Jena &ndash; according to tradition, on the night before the Battle of Jena, while Napoleon's troops were already occupying the city. Having seen Napoleon himself riding through the streets, he described him in a letter as "the world-soul on horseback." The octopus works on its system in seclusion, even as the world outside is in flames.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. Social Five: The System as Totem</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Naranjo called the <strong>social Five (SO5)</strong> <em>Totem</em>: knowledge is made available to the community, but only as part of a larger, self-constructed whole that gives the Five meaning and security. Hegel's entire body of work is exactly this impulse, thought through radically: he did not want to deliver isolated insights but a single system that seamlessly embeds logic, philosophy of nature, history, art, religion, and the state into one another &ndash; the "Science of Logic" (1812&ndash;1816) and the "Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences" (1817) were meant to explain, literally, everything explicable.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Central to this was his dialectical method: for Hegel, every thought, every historical epoch, every form of society carries within it an inner contradiction that drives it beyond itself, until it is sublated into a higher, more comprehensive unity. The totem of SO5 shows itself here in its most ambitious form: nothing is meant to remain outside the system &ndash; every contradiction is absorbed, processed, integrated.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Six-Wing: Security Through State and Teaching Authority</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Six-wing (w6)</strong> gives the social Five a deep need for security through institution and recognized authority. From 1818 Hegel taught at the University of Berlin, where he quickly rose to become the dominant philosophical authority in Prussia &ndash; his lectures drew hundreds of students, and his students formed a veritable school, "Hegelianism," which shaped German intellectual life for decades.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In his "Philosophy of Right" (1820) he formulated the line still debated today: "What is rational is actual; and what is actual is rational" &ndash; a line that contemporaries and posterity alike have often read as a justification of the existing Prussian state order. Hegel thereby effectively became the unofficial state philosopher of Prussia. The Six-wing seeks security not in individual deviation but in alignment between one's own system and the existing, reliable order.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Passion: Avarice as Systemic Completeness</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The passion of the Five is called <strong>avarice</strong> &ndash; in SO5w6 directed not at material possessions but at complete control over one's own intellectual territory. Hegel's notoriously difficult, often deliberately cryptic prose was an irritant to many contemporaries &ndash; Schopenhauer, for instance, called him a "spiritless, tasteless, revolting charlatan." Yet this difficulty can also be read as a protective mechanism: whoever wants full access to the system must first earn the effort of its language and method &ndash; a graduated access to knowledge, not unlike Pythagoras's secret brotherhood.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">His handling of philosophical rivals showed the same trait: his onetime fellow student Schelling, with whom he had shared a room at the Tübingen Stift, was scarcely acknowledged in Hegel's mature system, his earlier positions implicitly treated as a superseded preliminary stage of Hegel's own philosophy. The avarice of SO5w6 does not merely hoard knowledge &ndash; it claims to possess the one valid, final form of that knowledge.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Light and Shadow</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of SO5w6 shows in the sheer intellectual reach of Hegel's system: the idea that history has a discernible, rational course, that freedom unfolds step by step through world events, that contradiction is not mere disruption but the engine of knowledge &ndash; these ideas shaped the whole of 19th- and 20th-century philosophy, far beyond his immediate followers.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The shadow lies in the closure of the claim itself: a system that asserts it can explain everything leaves little room for what genuinely does not fit. Shortly after Hegel's death, his school split into Left Hegelians (Feuerbach, later Marx), who turned the system radically against religion and state, and Right Hegelians, who read it in a conservative, religious light &ndash; a rift that showed how much the system's supposed closure could itself become a battleground once the ordering authority of its author was gone.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Legacy: The Contradiction That Outlived Him</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Hegel died in 1831 in Berlin during a cholera epidemic, at the height of his standing as Prussia's leading philosopher. Barely a decade later his onetime student Karl Marx (SO8w9) began radically reinterpreting Hegel's dialectical method: he took over the dialectic but, as he himself put it, turned it "right side up again" &ndash; for Marx it was not spirit but material relations of production that drove history forward.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Søren Kierkegaard (SE2w1) also made "the System," as he usually just called it, a lifelong adversary: against Hegel's claim to embed the individual entirely within a higher, world-historical reason, he set the irreducible, precisely unsystematizable existence of the single person. The octopus with the Six-wing thus left behind no quiet monument, but a system that remained alive even in contradiction, through its sharpest critics: scarcely any 19th-century philosopher was fought so thoroughly and remained, all the same, so impossible to bypass.</p>

        <p class="krim-portrait-subtitle">German fashion designer, born 1965 &ndash; founder of POMPÖÖS &ndash; Animal correspondence: Hippopotamus</p>
      </div>
      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Hippopotamus</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Hippopotamus</strong> is the animal of the self-preservation Two &ndash; a creature that, wherever possible, builds itself a safe, protected territory it can move within, far from outside threat. It does not build its territory quietly, but with a presence that remains visible from far away.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The German fashion designer Harald Glööckler, born May 30, 1965, in Maulbronn-Zaisersweiher, Baden-Württemberg, Germany, grew up in a household he himself has described as traumatic: his father, who ran a restaurant together with his mother, was violent and alcoholic; Glööckler was also sexually abused as a child by a family acquaintance, something he could never speak about in that unstable household. When he was nineteen, his mother died after a fall. Yet already at age seven, inspired by his aunt, a seamstress, young Harald designed his first dress &ndash; a black lace dress with gold-colored lining. The longing for glamour and abundance was born early, in the middle of a childhood that was anything but glamorous.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Self-Preservation Two: Security Through Self-Created Abundance</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Naranjo called the <strong>self-preservation Two (SP2)</strong> <em>Me First</em>: care begins with one's own material and emotional security, before it turns outward. Where his parental home meant threat, violence, and scarcity, Glööckler built himself &ndash; with his brand <em>POMPÖÖS</em>, registered in 1990 after opening the fashion store "Jeans Garden" together with his longtime partner Dieter Schroth in Stuttgart in 1987 &ndash; a literal, overflowing, glamorous counter-world of his own: golden crowns, rhinestones, abundance instead of scarcity, excess instead of threat.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This care also stays concrete within his closest circle: his decades-long partnership with Dieter Schroth, both business and personal, has carried his career since the 1980s. At the same time, he engages very directly and concretely in animal welfare &ndash; as a declared opponent of fur in fashion, with vegan, cruelty-free collections, diverting part of the proceeds to donations, and through his partnership with the organization "Ein Herz für Kinder" (A Heart for Children). For the SP2, care is never abstract: it shows up in concrete products, concrete donations, a concrete relationship that has held for decades.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Three-Wing: The Brand as Armor</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Three-wing (w3)</strong> gives the self-preservation Two an instinct for image, impact, and recognizability. Glööckler's personal trademark &ndash; the golden crown, often paired with the "POMPÖÖS" lettering &ndash; is not incidental aesthetics, but a deliberately designed, consistently repeated emblem that runs through fashion, home accessories, and beauty products.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">His media presence follows the same pattern: as a reality TV star, he has appeared on shows including "Ich bin ein Star – Holt mich hier raus!" (the German "I'm a Celebrity") and "Promi Big Brother" &ndash; formats that offer maximum visibility on minimal script. The Three-wing turns the longing for security that stems from childhood into a publicly visible, consistently marketed image: not hiding, but showing plainly that one has made it.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. Light and Shadow of the Self-Preservation Two</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SP2w3 is the ability to build one's own, sustainable world out of a childhood without security &ndash; and not to keep that world to oneself, but to share it through concrete engagement for animals and disadvantaged children. Glööckler's decades-long partnership and his ongoing charitable work show that behind the glittering surface lies a very real, very reliable form of care.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The fate pattern of the Two is <strong>pride</strong> &ndash; the conviction of being indispensable and secure through one's own care and one's own achievement. In the SP2w3, this pride can turn into permanent, publicly visible self-staging: the need to keep demonstrating the security one has fought for, again and again, ever more visibly, rather than being able to rely on it internally. Glööckler's own, very deliberate decision against having children &ndash; on the grounds that a child is "a full-time job" and incompatible with his career &ndash; can be read as an expression of exactly this priority: self-built, controllable security over a new, uncontrollable dependency.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. The Work: Abundance as Counter-Design</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">For over three decades, POMPÖÖS has stood for an aesthetic that leaves no one indifferent: rhinestones, gold, crowns, opulent patterns &ndash; a deliberate counter-position to understatement and minimalism. This consistent excess is more than a matter of taste: it is the visible reversal of a childhood in which abundance, glamour, and security were missing.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">That Glööckler consistently links his commercial success with animal welfare engagement &ndash; vegan collections, an anti-fur stance, donations from proceeds &ndash; shows the typical SP2 pattern: self-created security does not become an end in itself, but flows back into concrete care for others.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Sloth</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The sloth is the animal of the sexual Type 9, and anyone watching Iga Świątek play understands why. The sloth appears as if half-asleep. It does not move unless it has to. Yet this impression is deceptive: the sloth is perfectly adapted to its environment. Every movement lands. No expenditure of energy without necessity. And when it snaps—it does so with a precision that is astonishing.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The Polish tennis player Iga Świątek, born in 2001 in Warsaw, Poland, is the most dominant tennis player of her generation. She won Roland Garros four times—2020, 2022, 2023, and 2024—the toughest clay-court tournament in the world. In addition, she won the US Open in 2022. She spent over 150 weeks as number one in the world rankings. And watching her, one asks: how does she do it so effortlessly?</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Sexual Nine: Disappearing into the Flow</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">According to Naranjo, the sexual Nine (SX9) is the subtype he called Union: the search for complete fusion with the other—the partner, the game, the moment. The SX9 does not lose itself. It finds itself in a state of complete presence where subject and object become one. What sports psychologists call flow is not an exceptional state for the SX9. It is its home.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Świątek describes her ideal game in exactly this way: no thinking, no planning, no inner commentary. Simply being there and playing. The ball comes—she responds. She does not decide what she does. The situation decides, and her body follows. In those moments, she says, tennis does not feel like work. It feels like taking a breath.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The One Wing: The Inner Judge</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The One wing gives the sexual Nine something that an SX9 with a weaker One wing lacks: a precise inner standard, a readiness for self-criticism, the ability to evaluate one's own performance coolly. The SX9w1 does not merely seek absorption—it seeks an absorption that is excellent. The flow alone is not enough. It must also be right.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Świątek works with sports psychologist Daria Abramowicz—an unusually open decision in a sport where psychological support is often taboo. Her handling of errors is striking: she does not react with anger or despair, but with quiet concentration. An error is information. It tells her where her alignment slipped. The One wing does not turn the Nine into a perfectionist in a neurotic sense, but into a player who knows exactly when she is not centered.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Work: The Dominance of Silence</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Świątek's game possesses a quality that commentators describe time and again without being able to fully explain: she never seems rushed. Her shots are no harder than those of other players in her era, but they come precisely when the pressure is at its peak, and they come with a consistency that exhausts match-winners. Świątek does not win by catching opponents off guard. She wins by remaining completely present until the opponent gives up trying to do the same.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Her father Tomasz Świątek was a rower at the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul—an athlete who prioritized endurance and rhythm over explosive power. The family influence is palpable. Świątek is not a player of spectacular isolated actions. She is a player of sustained flow. Not the big moment, but the great continuum.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Light and Shadow: When the Flow Breaks</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SX9w1 is its extraordinary power of concentration. Świątek can play entire tournaments in a state of complete presence that fades after a few sets in other players. On clay, she is virtually unbeatable when this state persists. The One wing ensures that she learns from errors without losing herself in them.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The shadow: the Nine loses itself in the flow, and when the flow breaks, everything sometimes collapses all at once. In 2022, Świątek lost the French Open quarterfinal against Iga Besidze in a set where she looked like a different player. In 2024, she failed in the Wimbledon round of 16 against Yulia Putintseva under striking circumstances. In those moments, what happens when the SX9w1 falls out of her center becomes visible: no anger, no fight—a kind of quiet disappearance. As if the connection were simply gone.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Sloth That Flies</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Iga Świątek is 23 years old. She has won four Grand Slam titles and is the undisputed number one of an era in which women's tennis is as balanced as rarely before. What sets her apart from others is not muscle power or tactics. It is the ability to be completely in the moment—set by set, point by point, as long as necessary.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The sloth looks like it is sleeping. But it exists in a form of presence that humans rarely attain. Świątek plays tennis the way the sloth hangs: effortlessly, calmly, completely in balance with what is. And sometimes, when the wind is right and the ball comes exactly as it should, something emerges that looks like weightlessness.</p>

        <p class="vb-intro" style="font-style:italic; opacity:0.75; margin-bottom:1.5rem;">Javier Parisi is the same subtype as John Lennon himself (SO4w5) &ndash; a rare case in which one person devotes an entire life to the meticulous embodiment of another person of the same subtype. A portrait about comparison, study, and the question of where one&#39;s own identity begins.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Armadillo</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>armadillo</strong> is the animal of the social Four &ndash; an animal full of contradictions: a hard shell on the outside, extraordinary sensitivity within. Not a loner, but a creature that needs community, even if it often feels foreign within it. And despite its uniqueness, it carries a paradox: it seeks its place precisely by ceaselessly comparing itself to others.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Javier Parisi, born in 1980 in Lanús near Buenos Aires, is known worldwide as perhaps the most uncanny John Lennon lookalike of our time &ndash; a man who has devoted his life to the exact embodiment of another person. The armadillo that does not content itself with its own shell, but puts on a second, borrowed one &ndash; and in doing so, paradoxically, finds itself.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Social Four: Comparison as a Way of Life</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>social Four (SO4)</strong> carries the pain of the Four into the social dimension. Naranjo called this subtype <em>shame</em>: the deep feeling of not quite belonging &ndash; combined with an incessant comparing of oneself to others, in the hope of finally finding confirmation there. No other subtype lives the Four&#39;s passion &ndash; envy, measuring oneself against others &ndash; as directly as the SO4.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In Parisi this comparison takes on an almost literal, hard-to-surpass form: he has oriented his whole life toward coming as close as possible to another person &ndash; in appearance, in voice, in gesture, in musical phrasing. As a child he discovered the Beatles at his parents&#39; house, began learning guitar at age eight and practicing English in order to understand the songs of his idols. What remains a passion for other fans became, for Parisi, a life&#39;s work: placing his own self beside a foreign one and standing his ground within that comparison.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">At twenty he founded his first Beatles tribute band with friends from his hometown &ndash; and made a decision that is characteristically SO4: it would not be enough to sound like the Beatles. One also had to look like them. The social Four seeks confirmation in the gaze of others &ndash; and Parisi found it by comparing and refining himself for so long that the comparison became indistinguishability.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Five-wing: Perfection Through Study</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Five-wing (w5)</strong> gives the social Four the capacity for concentrated, almost scientific depth. Where an SO4 with a more muted Five-wing mostly feels and compares, the Five-wing adds patient study: the willingness to penetrate a subject until one has fully mastered it.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In Parisi this shows in the sheer precision of his embodiment: not only the round glasses and the haircut, but the tone of voice, the stage movements, the Liverpudlian accent in his English, the exact chronology of Lennon&#39;s wardrobe across the various creative phases of the Beatles. This is no superficial imitation, but decades of meticulous research into a single biography. The Five-wing turns the SO4&#39;s admiration into craft.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This precision is what sets Parisi apart from ordinary tribute artists. His audiences repeatedly report the same moment: for seconds, the difference between original and embodiment disappears. That is the Five-wing in its most complete form &ndash; knowledge so deeply internalized that it no longer feels like knowledge, but like being.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. Abbey Road: Comparison Becomes Recognition</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">In April 2022, Parisi was invited to perform at the legendary Abbey Road Studios in London &ndash; the same place where the Beatles recorded much of their work. For a man whose entire life project is comparison with John Lennon, this was more than a concert: it was a form of confirmation from the very institution against which his role model had once measured himself.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Through social media, Parisi reached a global audience in the years that followed, one that shared his videos &ndash; including interpretations of &bdquo;Imagine&ldquo; and &bdquo;Now and Then&ldquo; &ndash; with a mixture of astonishment and emotion. The social Four lives for this moment of recognition: to be seen, not despite, but because of closeness to another. What began as a childhood passion in a suburb of Buenos Aires became a worldwide stage.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Light and Shadow of the Social Four</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SO4 is its ability to create, out of comparison with others, a form of connection that reaches far beyond itself. Parisi&#39;s performances let Beatles fans worldwide feel once more what Lennon&#39;s music once achieved &ndash; he keeps alive a memory that would otherwise exist only in recordings.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The fate pattern of the Four is <strong>envy</strong> &ndash; in the SO4 expressed as constant self-measurement. In Parisi this structure carries a particular risk: a life devoted to resemblance with another can push the question of one&#39;s own, unmistakable voice into the background. Where does homage end, and where does the loss of one&#39;s own face behind another&#39;s mask begin?</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The Five-wing brings the risk of immersing oneself so completely in an object of study that one&#39;s own perspective disappears behind it. Parisi himself has emphasized in interviews that he is motivated not only by the music but also by Lennon&#39;s message of peace and honesty &ndash; a sign that, for him, the embodiment is meant to be more than mere outward resemblance.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Healing Path: From Comparison to Own Expression</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The healing path of the Four leads from the question <em>Why am I less than the one I compare myself to?</em> to the insight <em>What I am is complete &ndash; and it is unique, even if I resemble another.</em> For the SO4w5 this means no longer treating years of studying a foreign role model as a substitute for one&#39;s own voice, but as a path through which that own voice is ultimately found.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Parisi&#39;s career shows glimpses of exactly this movement: from pure imitator to independent interpreter, who carries Lennon&#39;s message forward with his own expressive power rather than merely copying it. The armadillo that has learned that kinship with another does not erase one&#39;s own uniqueness &ndash; but, rightly understood, can be a path to discovering it in the first place.</p>

      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Armadillo on the Big Stage</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>armadillo</strong> is the animal of the social Four &ndash; a creature that does not hide its difference but wears it visibly on its skin. Unlike its more introverted counterparts, this Four does not retreat into its own shell but proudly displays it &ndash; as proof of its own uniqueness, on a stage everyone can see.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The American actor Johnny Depp was born in 1963 in Owensboro, Kentucky, grew up in a childhood marked by frequent moves and family tension, and dropped out of school at 15 to become a musician. Before becoming an actor, he played in bands, including with musicians who later ended up in Guns N' Roses &ndash; the longing for artistic expression was, from the start, bigger than any conventional career plan. His breakthrough came in 1987 with the television series "21 Jump Street" &ndash; a role he himself considered, for the rest of his life, too polished a teen-idol image, one that never fit his sense of himself as an artist.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Social Four: Uniqueness as a Work for the Stage</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>social Four (SO4)</strong> does not live its difference in hiding but seeks out the group, precisely in order to be seen there as the tragic, special exception. Depp's entire career is one long flight from the mass-market appeal: again and again he chose eccentric, often difficult outsider figures &ndash; Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, Sweeney Todd, the Hatter in "Alice in Wonderland" &ndash; figures that all share one thing: a deeply felt isolation, paired with a dazzling, unmistakable exterior.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Privately, too, Depp cultivated an unmistakable image for decades &ndash; rings on every finger, kohl eyeliner, hats, tattoos, a deliberately crafted rock-star persona that set him apart from the crowd even on the red carpet. This is typical of the social Four: one's own vulnerability is not hidden but transformed into an image that can fascinate others while also keeping them at a distance.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Three-Wing: Performance as a Way of Being</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Three-wing (w3)</strong> gives the Four the ability to successfully stage and market its uniqueness &ndash; the suffering remains real, but is condensed into a performance that reaches an audience of millions. No role shows this more clearly than Captain Jack Sparrow in "Pirates of the Caribbean": Depp developed the character on his own initiative, against the studio's wishes, into an eccentric, swaying rock-star pirate &ndash; an enormous artistic risk that grew into one of the most iconic characters in film history and one of cinema's biggest commercial successes.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">As a musician, too, Depp consistently sought the spotlight: in the supergroup Hollywood Vampires, he stood on major stages worldwide alongside Alice Cooper and Joe Perry. This mix of deep artistic ambition and an unconditional will to be present and recognized in front of an audience is the purest expression of the SO4w3: the Four feels it, the Three-wing performs it.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Price of the Public Stage</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">In 2022, Depp stood trial in an internationally watched defamation case against his ex-wife Amber Heard &ndash; a proceeding broadcast live on television and social media, followed by millions of viewers worldwide. For the social Four with a Three-wing, of all things the deepest personal pain, the accusation of domestic violence, and years of reputational damage became a public spectacle &ndash; a situation many people would have avoided at any cost, but which Depp, buoyed by an enormous wave of public sympathy, endured and saw through to the end on his own terms.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Remarkably, during the trial Depp himself became a staged figure &ndash; celebrated by his fans as a tragic hero, with merchandise, memes, and a genuine fan culture forming around his courtroom appearances. Here, in one of the darkest phases of his life, the social Four with a Three-wing paradoxically found the biggest public stage of its career.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Light and Shadow</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SO4w3 is the ability to turn <strong>deep feeling into powerful art</strong> &ndash; to create characters that, despite all their eccentricity, move audiences of millions because they carry genuine vulnerability within them. Depp's best roles thrive precisely on this willingness to fully surrender to a character, without regard for his own image.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The shadow showed itself in publicly documented periods of excess &ndash; alcohol and substance abuse, financial turbulence despite enormous fees, broken relationships. The flip side of the SO4w3: when the stage becomes the only source of validation, the line between genuine self-expression and pure performance can blur &ndash; and the need for recognition is never fully satisfied, no matter how loud the applause.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Armadillo That Turned Its Shell Into Art</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Johnny Depp remains one of the most idiosyncratic actors of his generation &ndash; an artist repeatedly willing to sacrifice commercial success for artistic risk, and precisely because of that one of Hollywood's most influential character actors. His body of work shows impressively how deeply felt isolation can give rise to a gallery of unforgettable outsider figures.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The armadillo that never hid its difference, but turned it into the most dazzling stage persona of its time &ndash; that is the lasting image of the social Four with a Three-wing: vulnerability that does not withdraw but steps out into the spotlight to be seen there.</p>

      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Golden Retriever</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Golden Retriever</strong> is the animal of the social Two &ndash; an animal that measures its own happiness by whether it can be useful to others, and that doesn't limit its warmth to a few people but wants to make it available to as many as possible. Dr. Katharina Tempel has turned exactly this drive into a mission: as the "Glücksdetektiv" (happiness detective), she reaches several hundred thousand people every month with scientifically grounded paths to greater wellbeing.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Katharina Tempel was born in June 1984, studied psychology, and earned her doctorate with a dissertation on exercises to increase wellbeing, for which she conducted a study involving more than 1,500 participants. Even her academic work was aimed at something beyond her own career: creating a solid, widely usable body of knowledge.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Social Two: Care Directed at an Entire Audience</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>social Two (SO2)</strong> directs its care not at individual relationships but at societal impact. Naranjo called this subtype <em>Ambition</em>: the drive to care for an entire collective through influence and reach. In 2013, Tempel founded the Glücksdetektiv platform to share her psychological knowledge and personal insights with a broad public &ndash; what began as pure knowledge-sharing gradually became active support for people navigating personal crises.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">With over 30,000 newsletter subscribers, several hundred thousand people reached monthly, and two bestsellers on the German SPIEGEL list &ndash; <em>Gib dir die Liebe, die du verdienst</em> and <em>Schenk dir das Leben, von dem du träumst</em> &ndash; the SO2 shows itself at its clearest: her own insight becomes a resource for an audience many times larger than her own immediate circle.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The One-Wing: Scientific Rigor Instead of Vague Self-Help</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>One-wing (w1)</strong> gives the social Two an inner axis of care and a need to pass on only what can actually be substantiated. In Tempel, this shows in the clear grounding of her work in empirical research: her dissertation, involving more than 1,500 study participants, is not a side note but the methodological foundation on which all her later Glücksdetektiv work rests.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This rigor sets her approach apart from the broad, often arbitrary self-help scene: instead of general motivational slogans, she offers evidence-based psychological interventions, combined with practical experience from online psychological counseling. The One-wing ensures that caring for a mass audience never comes at the expense of professional precision.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. Light and Shadow of the Social Two</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SO2w1 lies in the ability to turn an often painful personal experience into something that shows others a solid, scientifically grounded path. Tempel describes herself as having long been reserved and pessimistic &ndash; "at best neutral," as she puts it &ndash; before studying positive psychology fundamentally changed her own outlook. Out of that personal turning point came the drive to make the same possible for others.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The fate pattern of the Two is <strong>pride</strong> &ndash; the conviction of being indispensable for the wellbeing of others. In the SO2w1, this can show as a constant demand to keep supplying a growing audience with well-founded, correct answers &ndash; a standard that can become exhausting over time if it doesn't also account for one's own limits.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. The Work: From Personal Low Point to Scientifically Grounded Happiness Work</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">With books like <em>Genug gegrübelt, lieber Kopf</em>, a YouTube channel that ranks among the largest German-language offerings on the subject of happiness, and an ongoing online psychological counseling practice, Tempel has turned academic research into a daily-life tool for hundreds of thousands of people.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The Golden Retriever doesn't share its warmth out of obligation, but because that is where it finds its own meaning. Tempel's path from what she herself experienced as "at best neutral" to a scientifically grounded provider of wellbeing for a mass audience shows this drive at its most constructive: not hiding one's own crisis, but turning it into the foundation of a mission for many.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Gorilla</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Gorilla</strong> is the most powerful animal of the rainforest &ndash; and the most peaceful. It seeks no confrontation; it sits, eats, observes, and those who encounter it feel strangely safe in its presence. The Gorilla lives in a group, cares for those around it, and its size feels reassuring rather than threatening.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The American host Larry King, born 1933 as Lawrence Harvey Zeiger in Brooklyn, was exactly this Gorilla &ndash; a man with distinctive horn-rimmed glasses and suspenders, whose mere presence in a television studio had something calming about it. Over more than six decades in broadcasting he conducted more than 50,000 interviews &ndash; with seven US presidents, with world leaders, with murderers, with pop stars. What set him apart was not aggressiveness in conversation, but the opposite: the ability to create a space in which people felt safe enough to reveal something real.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Family: Closeness as a Profession</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Claudio Naranjo called the Self-Preservation Type 7 the <strong>Family</strong> &ndash; because this subtype seeks safety and joy not in the wider world, but in the closest circle, in familiar conversation, in the direct, warm connection between two people. That is exactly what King made his life's work: he turned the television interview, ordinarily a public and often confrontational format, into something intimate &ndash; a conversation at the kitchen table that happened to be watched by millions.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">His trademark was the open, unhurried question: <em>"Tell me about it."</em> Instead of cornering his guests, he gave them room. Critics later accused him of asking questions that were too soft &ndash; but exactly this softness was why even the most guarded celebrities and politicians opened up to him. The Gorilla does not build a territory through dominance. It builds it through trust.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Six-Wing: Loyalty and Reliability</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Six-wing (w6)</strong> gives the Self-Preservation Seven a stable, loyal foundation. Where the pure SP7 tends toward scattering, the w6 wing anchors it in reliability &ndash; in a fixed ritual, a recurring appointment, a role one can count on.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">King's career was exactly that: reliability across decades. <em>Larry King Live</em> ran from 1985 to 2010 on CNN, five nights a week, for 25 years &ndash; one of the longest-running shows with the same host in US television history. This constancy was by design, an expression of the Six-wing: the show as a safe place, at the same time every evening, no matter what happened in the world. Viewers and guests alike knew: King is there, reliable as a ritual.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Work: 50,000 Conversations</h2>

          <p class="vb-intro">King's career began in Miami radio in the 1950s, where he adopted his stage name because a producer thought his birth name too complicated. Over decades he built a reputation as an interviewer that eventually brought him to CNN in 1985, where he became the central voice of the still-young network &ndash; through Gulf Wars, presidential elections and world crises, as much as through gossip and pop culture.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">What distinguished King from other interviewers was the sheer breadth of his curiosity: in the same week he could discuss foreign policy with a sitting president and, the following night, a new comedy with a movie star. This versatility is the rawest form of SP7 joy in discovery &ndash; not specialist expertise, but an insatiable appetite to talk with anyone who had something to say.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Light and Shadow</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SP7w6 is its ability to generate real closeness without losing its own warmth, even after tens of thousands of conversations. King remained curious about people well into old age &ndash; a quality many talk show hosts lose after decades in the business.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The shadow shows in a life full of financial and personal turbulence: in 1971 King was charged with embezzlement, temporarily lost his job, and although the charges were later dropped, financial ruin followed him for years. Privately he married eight times, divorced seven times &ndash; a pattern that reveals the flip side of the SP7: the longing for a safe nest, paired with a restlessness that keeps leaving it. In 1987 he suffered a severe heart attack that changed him lastingly &ndash; he subsequently founded the Larry King Cardiac Foundation to fund heart surgery for people who could not afford it. His own vulnerability turned into care for others.</p>

          <p class="vb-intro">Larry King died in 2021 at the age of 87, after a life spent almost entirely in conversation with other people &ndash; and yet, as those who knew him described it, one that often left his own inner life in the background. The man who helped millions of others open up remained, himself, often hard to grasp.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This is exactly the essence of the SP7w6: joy and safety are found in contact with others, not in introspection. King's legacy is not a single great interview, but the sheer volume of moments in which one person, facing another, said something true for the first time &ndash; because the Gorilla in the studio made them feel it was safe to do so.</p>

        <p class="krim-portrait-subtitle">Federal Minister of Economics 1949&ndash;1963, Chancellor 1963&ndash;1966, 1897&ndash;1977 &ndash; Animal correspondence: Elephant</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Elephant</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Elephant</strong> is the animal of Type 9 &ndash; and few images fit Ludwig Erhard better. The elephant is a heavy, calm animal that needs no noise to have an effect. It moves slowly, deliberately, with a presence that simply is, whether or not anyone is watching. Once it is in motion, little can stop it.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The German politician Ludwig Erhard, born in 1897 in Fürth, was this elephant: portly, seemingly relaxed, cigar in hand and calm of voice &ndash; and yet the man who led Germany out of the rubble of the Second World War into one of the most stable economies in Europe. No revolutionary, no speaker who swept up crowds. A man who held on persistently to an idea until it became reality.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Self-Preservation Nine: Appetite for Stability</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Self-Preservation Nine (SP9)</strong> is what Naranjo called <em>Appetite</em>: the SP9 seeks peace and security through consistency, through routine, through enjoying the simple, reliable things in life. He is no fighter for spectacular upheaval &ndash; he is someone who builds a solid foundation and trusts that stability itself is the most persuasive message.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Erhard's entire economic career was exactly this: not a fight for attention, but the persistent construction of a stable order. As Federal Minister of Economics, he pushed through the abolition of price controls in 1948 against considerable resistance from the Allied military government and large parts of German politics &ndash; a step that seemed risky, but showed precisely the calm, principled trust that characterises the SP9: he believed in the system he had designed and let it simply work.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The One-Wing: Principled Conviction as Economic Order</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>One-wing</strong> gives the Self-Preservation Nine a special quality: a deep sense of order, of what is right, of principles that are not negotiable. The <strong>SP9w1</strong> is not only patient &ndash; he is also shaped by an inner moral clarity that tolerates no compromise on core values.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Erhard's life's work, the Social Market Economy, is the One-wing in its purest form: a free market economy, but embedded in a clear regulatory framework that protects competition and secures social balance. “Prosperity for all” was, for him, no advertising slogan but a moral principle he defended with the same unshakeable conviction as an SP9w1 defends his inner principles. He tolerated no deviation from this framework &ndash; neither from the left nor from the right.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Work: From the Economic Miracle to the Chancellorship</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">As Federal Minister of Economics from 1949 to 1963 under Konrad Adenauer, Erhard laid the foundation for what became known as the “economic miracle”: the unprecedented economic recovery of West Germany after the war. The currency reform of 1948, which he helped shape, followed by his consistent policy of free price formation, set an economy that had been flat on the ground into motion within just a few years.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In 1963, Erhard, now Adenauer's successor, became Chancellor &ndash; an office that suited him politically far less than the Ministry of Economics. His chancellorship (1963&ndash;1966) was marked by reckoning with the postwar period, deepening European integration, and growing domestic political tensions. The elephant who had excelled as an economic architect struggled more as a political leader &ndash; the SP9 can act more hesitantly in leadership positions when confrontation, rather than consensus, is required.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Light and Shadow</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SP9w1 is his <strong>ability to create lasting structures out of principled patience</strong>. Erhard's Social Market Economy still shapes Germany's economic order today &ndash; a legacy that reaches far beyond his own term in office, precisely because it was built not on spectacular individual decisions but on a stable, internally coherent system.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The shadow shows in exactly the inertia inherent in the SP9: Erhard reacted hesitantly, almost passively, to the growing budget crises and rising domestic criticism during his chancellorship, until the governing coalition collapsed in 1966 and he was forced to resign. The elephant who patiently endures can, in the wrong situation, endure too long &ndash; until the decision is taken out of his hands rather than made by him.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Elephant Who Built an Order That Outlasted Him</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The healing path of the Nine leads from inertia to genuine agency &ndash; from self-forgetting in the status quo to an active, conscious shaping of one's own vision. Erhard found this path above all during his years as Minister of Economics, when, though ridiculed by many, he held with quiet persistence to his economic conviction until it proved right.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Erhard died in 1977 in Bonn, but the Social Market Economy he designed still carries Germany today. That is the SP9w1 at its most mature: not an elephant that trumpets loudly, but one that builds an order so stable it still stands long after he himself is gone.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The armadillo that became the armadillo</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>armadillo</strong> is the animal of the Social Four &ndash; it does not seek belonging by blending into the crowd, but through an entirely its own, unmistakable role within a community, a role that is what makes it visible in the first place. Few lives illustrate this pattern as literally as that of Dr. Mariella Superina: the Swiss veterinarian is today the world's recognized foremost authority on armadillos &ndash; a woman whose archetypal animal is the armadillo, and who became exactly that: the internationally celebrated authority on it.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Raised in Switzerland, where armadillos naturally do not exist, the Swiss wildlife biologist Dr. Mariella Superina encountered the animal almost by chance on a farm in Brazil &ndash; fascinated by how little was known about them at all. That encounter grew into a doctoral thesis at the University of Zurich on the biology and husbandry of armadillos, followed by a second doctorate in Conservation Biology at the University of New Orleans on the pichi, a small armadillo species in Argentina.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Social Four: significance through an irreplaceable role</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Social Four (SO4)</strong> seeks its worth not in withdrawal, but in a special, irreplaceable standing within a community &ndash; it does not want to be just any member, but the one whose absence would leave something essential missing. Superina became exactly that: since 2009 she has chaired the IUCN SSC Anteater, Sloth and Armadillo Specialist Group, the World Conservation Union's global expert network for this group of animals &ndash; a position that made her, over decades, the central, uncontested authority on armadillo conservation worldwide.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">It is telling how she speaks about her own work: research, she stresses explicitly, is "always teamwork" &ndash; not a solo project, but a shared cause she carries together with international colleagues and authorities. This is the Social Four exactly: one's own uniqueness arises not against the community, but through a special role within it.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Five-wing: decades in service of a single field of knowledge</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Five-wing (w5)</strong> gives the Four an analytical depth and an enormous thirst for knowledge &ndash; one's own interest in a subject is not merely felt but translated into systematic, meticulous expertise. Over more than two decades of fieldwork, Superina studied the behavior, torpor, and biology of numerous armadillo species across South America &ndash; from chasing animals through tall grass to researching their torpor and overwintering mechanisms, with well over a hundred scientific publications and thousands of citations.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Her own guiding line &ndash; roughly: "Keep them in your heart, but leave them in the wild" &ndash; shows this Five-wing distance at its most mature: deep affection for the research subject, but without possessiveness, without tearing the animal from its natural context. Knowledge here is not accumulated to possess, but to protect.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. Light and shadow</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SO4w5 is its ability to turn <strong>its own uniqueness into an irreplaceable role within society</strong> &ndash; Superina's decades of research and her international chairmanship have moved a whole, previously overlooked family of animals into the center of global species conservation. Without her, verifiably, the world's knowledge of armadillos would be poorer today.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The shadow of the Social Four shows where one's own significance stays too tightly bound to a single, highly specialized niche &ndash; a field that remains exotic and hard to access for most people, however significant it is professionally. The flip side of the special role: the more unique one's own niche, the lonelier the path within it can become.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. The armadillo that stands for the armadillo</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">What Superina gives the world is not merely scientific detail, but an entire genus that, without her decades of persistence, would be far less protected today. The Social Four with a Five-wing does not ask: how do I stand out? It asks: which role is still missing that only I can fill?</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In the end, one image remains that could hardly stand more fittingly for this pattern: a woman whose archetypal animal is the armadillo, who became the world's recognized voice for exactly that animal &ndash; not through withdrawal, but through a role within the international community that no one else could fill quite the same way.</p>

        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Golden Retriever</strong> is the animal of the social Two &ndash; an animal that warms every room and doesn't wait to be asked, but volunteers what matters right now. Micky Beisenherz built an entire career out of exactly this drive: as one of the most-listened-to voices in German-language news podcasting, guiding millions of people through world events every day.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Michael Beisenherz was born on June 28, 1977, in Recklinghausen and grew up in Castrop-Rauxel as the son of a master plumber. After graduating high school he studied social sciences in Bochum for one semester, then spent a year working construction before an internship at a local radio station led him to Radio NRW &ndash; a path that didn't lead straight to the stage, but took detours that kept him grounded.</p>

        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>social Two (SO2)</strong> directs its care not at individual relationships but at societal impact. Naranjo called this subtype <em>Ambition</em>: the drive to be present for an entire collective through influence and public reach. Since 2020, Beisenherz has co-hosted the podcast <em>Apokalypse & Filterkaffee</em> with Nikki Hassan-Nia &ndash; a format that explicitly presents itself as opinion journalism: not detached news reading, but daily context-setting with a recognizable point of view.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In 2022, the podcast ranked among the most-listened-to German-language formats of all &ndash; an audience that reliably lets the same voice guide it through world events every morning. The same care shows in his journalistic side work: since 2016 he has written columns for <em>Stern</em>, and regularly for <em>Süddeutsche Zeitung</em> and <em>Die Zeit</em> &ndash; always with the same underlying pattern of making complex events accessible and pointed for a broad audience.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The One-Wing: Conviction Instead of Mere Entertainment</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>One-wing (w1)</strong> gives the social Two an inner axis of principled conviction and a need to name things clearly rather than lose itself in mere agreeableness. This is exactly what sets <em>Apokalypse & Filterkaffee</em> apart from ordinary entertainment: the podcast explicitly presents itself as opinion journalism that takes a position instead of simply laying out events side by side.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This stance runs through his entire body of work: as a joke writer for satirical shows like <em>extra3</em>, as a writer for <em>Late Night Berlin</em>, in his columns, which regularly offer pointed commentary on social and political issues. The One-wing ensures that behind the sharp language there is always a recognizable, consistent position &ndash; not opinion for the sake of provocation, but the claim of naming what is right clearly.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. Light and Shadow of the Social Two</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SO2w1 lies in the ability to freshly process complex, often unsettling world events for a broad audience every single day, without slipping into mere sensationalism. That Beisenherz has reliably hosted for years &ndash; from the WDR talk show <em>Kölner Treff</em>, whose succession from Bettina Böttinger he took over in 2023, to several parallel podcast formats &ndash; shows a reliability that goes beyond mere presence.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The fate pattern of the Two is <strong>pride</strong> &ndash; the conviction of being indispensable to the audience. In the SO2w1, this can show as a constant pressure to remain present, sharp, and opinionated every single day, regardless of how exhausting that can become over time. A format that turns itself into a daily institution carries exactly this claim within it: never to fail to appear, always to deliver clear orientation.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. The Work: From Local Radio to the Daily Voice of a Generation</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">From Radio Herne through Radio NRW, where he was for a time part of comedian Mario Barth's crew, to his own TV formats, books like <em>Schreib oder Stirb</em> (with Sebastian Fitzek), and the 2006 Axel Springer Prize for young journalists, a single thread runs through Beisenherz's career: the steady expansion of his own audience, without losing the directness of local radio he started with.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The Golden Retriever doesn't stay quiet out of restraint – it speaks up the moment it has something to say to its pack. Beisenherz's simultaneous daily presence across multiple formats &ndash; podcast, talk show, column &ndash; is exactly this drive in its most consistent form: an audience that relies, day after day, on being guided through the world by the same familiar voice.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Rabbit</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>rabbit</strong> is watchful, loyal, and seeks safety in what it knows. It is not an animal of the grand gesture. It lives in the familiar, carefully builds out its territory \u2013 and when the situation demands it, shows a determination no one would have expected from the outside. The rabbit does not survive through strength, but through wits, reliability, and the trust of its group.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The American astronaut Neil Armstrong was the first human to set foot on the moon. On July 20, 1969, at 02:56 UTC, he placed his left foot on the lunar surface and spoke a sentence the world still knows. Afterward he did everything to disappear back into silence. He gave almost no interviews. He fled the public eye. He returned to Ohio, to his farm, and lived there as inconspicuously as if he had only taken a brief trip \u2013 to the moon and back. That is the rabbit: the most extraordinary human being ever to leave his footprint in the dust \u2013 who afterward wanted nothing more than normalcy.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. Warmth: Safety Through Trust</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Claudio Naranjo called the Self-Preservation Type 6 <strong>Warmth</strong> \u2013 because this subtype seeks safety through human closeness and belonging. The SE6 is loyal, reliable, team-oriented. It radiates a calm that reassures others \u2013 and it needs the group's trust as much as it gives it.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Armstrong was no hero of grand words. When he stood on the moon, he did not say <em>I did it</em>, but: <em>The Eagle has landed.</em> We. The team. Mission Control in Houston. Buzz Aldrin beside him. Michael Collins in lunar orbit. Armstrong set foot on the moon \u2013 but he never understood it as his personal triumph. He was the representative of a community. And precisely that mattered to him.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">His colleagues described him as calm, reliable, and matter-of-fact. He spoke little in critical situations \u2013 and when he did, it was precise. During the approach to the moon, the onboard computer threw error messages and the landing site turned out to be a boulder field. Armstrong manually took over control, calmly searched for a safe spot \u2013 and landed with a fuel reserve that would have lasted less than thirty seconds. No panic, no drama. That is the SE6 at its peak: safety through competence, calm as a protective principle.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Five-Wing: Mastery Through Knowledge</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Five-wing (w5)</strong> gives the Self-Preservation Six a characteristic depth: a retreat into the technical, a hunger for mastery, the conviction that safety arises above all through precise knowledge and thorough preparation, not through social closeness alone. The SE6w5 opens itself to the world not through enthusiasm, but through competence \u2013 and precisely there lies the key to Armstrong's entire life.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Armstrong flew for the first time at age six \u2013 with his father, in a Ford Trimotor, a three-engine passenger aircraft widely used in the US during the 1920s. From then on he wanted to be a pilot, and he approached that goal like a Five: systematically, technically, through knowledge rather than impulse. By sixteen he had his pilot's license before he even had a driver's license. He studied aerospace engineering, flew seventy-six combat missions in the Korean War, and became a test pilot who flew the X-15 to an altitude of over 60 kilometers \u2013 at the edge of space. He aptly described himself as a "white-socks, pocket-protector, nerdy engineer" \u2013 not an adventurer, but a technician who worked his way into ever riskier aircraft because he understood them down to the last detail. That is the SE6w5: courage that arises from mastery, not from enthusiasm.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In 1966, on Gemini 8, he performed the first successful docking maneuver of two spacecraft in space \u2013 and saved the mission when the spacecraft went into an uncontrolled roll, by keeping a cool head and making the technically correct decision within seconds. Not a spontaneous instinct, but years of trained engineering knowledge that was ready to call on at the decisive moment. The Five-wing gives the rabbit no wanderlust \u2013 it gives it the depth with which it fully masters every new field.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Work: Twenty-One Hours on the Moon</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">On July 20, 1969, the Apollo 11 lunar module <em>Eagle</em> landed in the Sea of Tranquility. Armstrong and Aldrin spent twenty-one hours and thirty-six minutes on the moon \u2013 about two hours and twenty minutes of it outside the module. Armstrong collected rock samples, took photographs, planted the American flag. And he spoke the sentence:</p>
          <p class="vb-intro"><em>That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.</em></p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The small word <em>a</em> before <em>man</em> was lost in the radio static \u2013 and Armstrong later insisted he had said it. Without the <em>a</em>, the sentence has no logical contrast: <em>man</em> is then synonymous with <em>mankind</em>. With the <em>a</em>, however, he meant the single individual \u2013 and that is exactly what Armstrong was: a single individual who went for everyone. He clarified this distinction his whole life. That is the SE6: precision in language, correctness as a value.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">After his return he was showered with parades and receptions. He then taught aerospace engineering at the University of Cincinnati \u2013 for eight years, quietly, reliably, without fuss. Then he returned to his farm in Ohio.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Light and Shadow: The Most Famous Unknown Man</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SE6w5 is its <strong>integrity</strong>. Armstrong could have become rich \u2013 through endorsement deals, appearances, his own name. He turned down almost everything. When he found out his signature was being sold for thousands of dollars, he stopped signing autographs. When a barber sold a clipping of his hair after a haircut, Armstrong threatened to sue unless the money went to charity. He meant it.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The shadow: the SE6 can freeze in its tendency toward withdrawal. After the moon flight, Armstrong grew so quiet that some wondered whether he was depressed. He rarely spoke about the experience \u2013 not because it had not moved him, but because he found no words that did justice to the reality of it. Just once, in an interview shortly before his death, he admitted: <em>It was the greatest experience of my life. And I still can't really explain it today.</em> That is the SE6: what is too large for words stays inside.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">His daughter Karen died in 1962 at age two of a brain tumor. Armstrong hardly ever spoke about it publicly. Only once did he say that after her death he began getting up especially early in the morning \u2013 before anyone else was awake \u2013 to be alone. The rabbit withdraws when the pain is too great. And carries it silently.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Rabbit Returns Home</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Neil Armstrong died on August 25, 2012, in Cincinnati, Ohio \u2013 following complications from heart bypass surgery. He was eighty-two years old. He spent his last decade largely on his farm in Lebanon, Ohio. Gardening, farming, the everyday life of a man who was not great because he wanted to be, but because history had made him so.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">After his death, his family released a statement that ended with a sentence that describes Armstrong as well as almost any other: <em>If you want to honor him, look up at the moon on the next clear evening, wave, and think of Neil Armstrong.</em></p>
          <p class="vb-intro">That is the SE6w5: a person who did the greatest thing a human being had ever done up to that point \u2013 and afterward wanted only one thing: to go home. The rabbit set foot on the moon. And returned to where it belonged.</p>

        <p class="krim-portrait-subtitle">British musician, b. 1950 &ndash; Animal correspondence: Dove</p>
      </div>
      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Dove</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>dove</strong> is the animal of the Self-Preservation Four – it does not put its depth on loud display, but processes it in persistent, often years-long withdrawal. Peter Gabriel was born in 1950 in Woking, England, sang as a child in the church choir, and learned drums before forming a band with schoolmates Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford at Charterhouse School – the group that became Genesis in 1967. Out of this sheltered, middle-class upbringing came not a loud self-promoter but a brooding, introverted young man who first processed his inner world mainly through song lyrics.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Only over the years did this quiet depth grow into a wholly distinctive stage presence – a pattern that recurs again and again in the Self-Preservation Four: it is rarely the spotlight itself that the Four seeks out, but the need to make complex inner images communicable at all that eventually, almost inevitably, drives them onto the stage.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Self-Preservation Four: Family Before the Band</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Self-Preservation Four (SP4)</strong> places its own family above all else in existential crises – even above a career that has just reached its peak. In 1974, during the elaborate production of the Genesis double album "The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway," Gabriel's daughter Anna was born after a difficult delivery with life-threatening complications. While the band worked on the recordings in Wales, his wife Jill lay with the baby between life and death in a London clinic.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Gabriel repeatedly made the five-hour drive between the studio and the hospital bedside, refused to leave his family alone in this extraordinary situation, and increasingly clashed with his bandmates as a result. The tension arising from this prioritization was one of the central reasons he left the band in August 1975 – at the height of its commercial success. A typical SP4 decision: one's own closest bonds outweigh public fame.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Three-wing: The Self-Made Stage Figure</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Three-wing (w3)</strong> gives the Self-Preservation Four a pronounced sense for impact, staging, and public performance – the inner world of images is not hidden but translated into a visible, often self-invented role. As Genesis's singer, Gabriel devised an entire gallery of self-designed costumes and masks for the band's concerts: "The Watcher of the Skies," "Britannia," "The Slipperman," the flower for "Supper's Ready" – each figure created specifically for a particular song's content, usually without consulting the rest of the band.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This practice of translating deeply private inner narratives into a self-made, unmistakable outer image continued into his solo career: the four untitled albums at the start of his solo years, the stop-motion "Sledgehammer" video that won nine MTV Video Music Awards in 1986, the multi-million-selling album "So" – in every case, Gabriel himself stood behind the visual concept. In this his pattern resembles that of the other SP4w3s in this compass: a deeply private imagery that does not stay hidden but is made publicly visible (compare the portrait of <a href="#beruehmte-honore-de-balzac">Honoré de Balzac (SP4w3)</a>, who likewise created his own public figure).</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Fox's Head and the Red Dress</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">On September 28, 1972, during a concert in Dublin, Gabriel surprised both the audience and his own bandmates when he suddenly appeared on stage during "The Musical Box" wearing a fox's head and his wife's long red dress – without announcement, without rehearsal. The other musicians learned of the figure he had devised for this performance only at that very moment.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This episode stands as an exemplary case of the SP4w3 pattern: the creative decision was made entirely alone, in withdrawal, and became public only at the moment of performance – for Gabriel, interiority and performance often coincided in that single instant, without the detour of consultation or compromise.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Light and Shadow</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SP4w3 lies in its ability to <strong>translate a wholly personal inner imagery into a publicly effective form that also serves others</strong>. Gabriel used this gift far beyond his own music: in 1982 he founded the WOMAD festival for world music, with Real World Records a label that gave countless musicians outside the Western mainstream a platform, and in 1992 the human-rights organization Witness, which equipped activists worldwide with video technology to document human-rights abuses – for which he received the "Man of Peace" award from Nobel laureates in 2006.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The shadow showed in Gabriel's notorious perfectionism: gaps of four, five, sometimes ten years often separated his solo albums, because individual tracks were repeatedly discarded and rebuilt until they fully matched his inner image – a thoroughness that produced artistically striking results but repeatedly worked against him commercially.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Dove Behind the Mask</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Peter Gabriel is among the most influential musicians of the second half of the twentieth century – not because he put himself forward more loudly than others, but because he shaped his private imagery so consistently and independently that it became an entirely distinct artistic language, from the Genesis masks to "Sledgehammer."</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The dove that began in a church choir and, decades later, appeared on stage behind self-invented masks without ever losing sight of his own family – that is the lasting image of this subtype: a person who does not hide their own depth, but translates it into form, image, and performance without losing themselves in the process.</p>

        <p class="krim-portrait-typ">SX1w2 &middot; Sexual Type 1 with Two-wing</p>
        <p class="krim-portrait-subtitle">Herpetologist, born 1943 &ndash; "The Snakeman of India," Padma Shri laureate &ndash; Animal correspondence: Black Mamba</p>
      </div>
      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Black Mamba</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Black Mamba</strong> is the animal of the sexual One &ndash; lightning-fast, precise, uncompromising, entirely focused on a single law. Romulus Whitaker, born in the United States and raised in India from the age of eight, is known as "The Snakeman of India" and was honored with the Padma Shri, one of India's highest civilian awards.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">An honest note up front, similar to Dr. Peter Sharpe (SE1w9) and the golden eagle versus the bald eagle: Whitaker's actual life's work centers primarily on the king cobra &ndash; the Agumbe Rainforest Research Station, which he founded in 2005, is today the world's leading center for king cobra research. The exact species therefore differs from his animal correspondence, the black mamba. But as with the eagle, the same holds for snakes: the Enneagram does not distinguish here by species, but by the archetypal principle of the snake itself &ndash; lightning-fast, precise, incorruptible in its own law. And Whitaker embodies exactly this principle across his entire life's work, regardless of the individual species.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Sexual One: Fifty Years, One Mission</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Naranjo called the <strong>sexual One (SX1)</strong> <em>Jealousy</em> or <em>Zeal</em> &ndash; a passion that concentrates with missionary intensity on a single cause. Over five decades, Whitaker founded one institution after another, always circling the same core theme: in 1969, the Madras Snake Park, India's first of its kind, with a 25-paise admission fee; in 1976, together with his then-wife Zai Whitaker, the Madras Crocodile Bank Trust; and finally, in 2005, the Agumbe Rainforest Research Station.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">His own creed captures the SX1 stance exactly: "Follow your dream. Unwavering passion and dedication are key." And as with Thea Litschka-Koen (SX1w2), his mission is directed not against dangerous animals but toward education and coexistence &ndash; instead of eradication, he advocates scientific understanding. A firm moral conviction from which an unwavering way of life follows.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Two-Wing: Community Instead of Solitude</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">An SX1 with a more muted Two-wing would likely have pursued its mission more solitarily &ndash; similar to Bill Haast (SX1w9), who spent his life in radical solitude and self-experimentation. In Whitaker, a distinctly outward-facing, community-building pattern shows instead: he built the Crocodile Bank together with his wife as a partnership project, much like Litschka-Koen with her husband Clifton.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Perhaps his most striking achievement, however, is social in nature: he transformed the Irula, an indigenous community of traditional snake hunters, into a cooperative of snake protectors who earned a dignified livelihood through venom extraction for medical research. That is the Two-wing at its most mature: not working alone, but empowering others, bringing an entire community along.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. Visibility Instead of Retreat</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Whitaker documented his work in books and films over decades and became a publicly visible figure in India's conservation movement &ndash; a clear contrast to Haast's withdrawn, almost monastic style. He describes himself with dry humor: "People often mistake me for a rabid hippie conservationist." His honors include the Whitley Award, the Rolex Award, the Order of the Golden Ark, and the Salim Ali Award.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This combination of unwavering, decades-long devotion to a dangerous cause (the One) and the consistent building of communities, partnerships, and public visibility (the Two-wing) is the SX1w2 at its most effective.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. The Snake That Changed an Entire Community</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Romulus Whitaker's life's work shows the sexual One with a Two-wing at its farthest-reaching: a relentless devotion to a single principle sustained for more than fifty years &ndash; translated not into solitary pursuit, but into institutions, partnerships, and an entire transformed community.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The snake follows an inner law without exception. Whitaker's law was: snakes deserve understanding rather than fear &ndash; and he did not pass that law on alone, but together with everyone he could win over to it.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Lion Who Roused Athens</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>lion</strong> is the animal of Social Type 8 &ndash; a predator that does not deploy its strength for itself but in service of the pride. Socrates was born around 470 BC in Athens, the son of a stonemason, and as an adult served several times as a heavily armed hoplite in the Peloponnesian War &ndash; at Potidaea, Delium, and Amphipolis. Tradition holds that he saved the life of his younger comrade Alcibiades there, carrying him wounded from the battlefield, and on another occasion stood motionless in thought for a full day and night in the army camp, undeterred by ridicule or cold.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This physical and mental unshakeability remained his trademark his entire life: walking barefoot in winter, indifferent to comfort, incorruptible in his convictions. The lion does not withdraw when things grow uncomfortable &ndash; it holds its ground, for itself and for those entrusted to it.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. Social Eight: Solidarity With the Polis</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Naranjo called <strong>Social Eight (SO8)</strong> <em>Solidarity</em>: it places its strength in the service of the community, not in the service of its own safety or a single relationship. In Socrates this shows most clearly in the dialogue "Crito": after he was sentenced to death in 399 BC, his wealthy friend Crito offered him escape from prison, complete with ready plans and bribed guards. Socrates refused.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">His reasoning was no resignation but a radical loyalty to the order that had raised him: whoever has profited throughout their life from the laws of Athens &ndash; education, protection, citizenship &ndash; may not evade them the moment they turn unfavorable, even if the verdict was unjust. This is Social Eight in its most uncompromising form: solidarity not only with the people one loves, but with the community itself, whatever the cost.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Seven-Wing: Appetite for the Full Life</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Seven-wing (w7)</strong> gives Social Eight a restless, appetitive energy &ndash; the hunger to savor life in its full abundance rather than withdraw from it. Socrates spent his days not in a quiet study but in the marketplace, in the gymnasiums, on the busy street corners of Athens, drawing craftsmen, politicians, and young men alike into conversation &ndash; never to lecture, but to provoke.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In his defense speech, the "Apology," he compared himself to a gadfly perched on a large but sluggish, noble horse, keeping it awake: Athens was that great but drowsy animal, and he himself the gadfly stinging it day after day so it would not fall asleep in self-satisfaction. His conduct at social gatherings was equally legendary: in Plato's "Symposium," Alcibiades reports that Socrates could drink everyone under the table without appearing drunk himself, and was the only one who walked home sober and upright the next morning. Pleasure, sociability, and mental alertness went hand in hand in him.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Passion: Lust as Relentless Questioning</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The passion of the Eight is called <strong>lust</strong> &ndash; not a sexual but an existential hunger for unfiltered, full life. In SO8w7, this hunger is directed at conversation itself: Socrates apparently could not stop asking questions. His daimonion, an inner divine voice, according to tradition only ever warned him against doing something wrong &ndash; it never once stopped him from asking uncomfortable questions.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This relentlessness came at a price: Socrates systematically exposed the supposed wisdom of respected politicians, poets, and craftsmen by entangling them in contradictions &ndash; and made powerful enemies in the process. When he was put on trial in 399 BC for impiety and corrupting the youth, he provocatively proposed to the jury, as his counter-penalty, that he be honored instead with free meals in the Prytaneum &ndash; like an Olympic champion. The court then sentenced him to death by an even larger majority than the one that had found him guilty.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Death: Steadfastness as a Final Lesson</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">In prison, surrounded by grieving friends, Socrates spent his final hours not in lament but in a conversation about the immortality of the soul &ndash; recorded in Plato's dialogue "Phaedo." When the cup of hemlock was handed to him, he drank it calmly, walked about the room until his legs grew heavy, and lay down. His last words, it is said, concerned an everyday request: that a rooster be sacrificed to the healing god Asclepius on his behalf, a debt he owed.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This composure in the face of death is not a refutation of the lion but its most mature form: Social Eight with the Seven-wing does not fear the end when it knows it has remained true to its community and its convictions. Steadfast to the last, without bitterness and without attempting escape &ndash; a final proof of solidarity with the laws he had served his whole life.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Legacy: The Gadfly That Never Fell Silent</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Socrates himself wrote nothing down &ndash; everything passed down about him comes from the works of his students, above all Plato and Xenophon, as well as the mocking comedies of Aristophanes. This very refusal to cast his thinking into fixed texts fits SO8w7: truth for him was not a possession to be archived, but a living event within conversation, in direct contact between people.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The lion with the Seven-wing thus left behind no closed doctrine, but a method and a stance: the tireless questioning of comfortable certainties, joined to a loyalty to community that did not waver even in the face of his own death sentence. From his student Plato through Aristotle and into the whole of Western philosophy, Socrates remained the gadfly that kept generations of thinkers awake, never letting them settle into rest.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Elephant They Called the "Dumb Ox"</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>elephant</strong> is the animal of the self-preservation Nine &ndash; a massive, calm presence that works not through volume but through weight. Thomas Aquinas, born around 1225 near Aquino in the Kingdom of Sicily, was physically such an elephant already: large, heavy, deliberate in his movements. His fellow students at the University of Paris, because of his silent manner and massive build, gave him the nickname "the dumb ox" (bos mutus).</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">His teacher Albertus Magnus is said to have answered prophetically: "You call him the dumb ox, but his bellowing in doctrine will one day resound throughout the world." The elephant appears slow and unremarkable &ndash; until one recognizes the weight behind its calm.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. Self-Preservation Nine: Calm as a Daily Practice</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Naranjo called the <strong>self-preservation Nine (SP9)</strong> <em>appetite</em>: the tendency to settle into comfort, routine, and inner calm rather than being thrown off course by outer disturbance. In Thomas this showed as an almost unimaginable work discipline that nevertheless never seemed rushed: contemporaries report that he could dictate different works to several scribes at once while pacing calmly around the room &ndash; steady, methodical, without visible strain.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This calm extended to his bodily well-being as well: Thomas was known for his considerable size and his enjoyment of food &ndash; legend has it that a semicircular section was cut into the table at his usual place so he could sit comfortably. The SP9 seeks peace not through renunciation but through comfortably settling into one's own life &ndash; in Thomas this combined with one of the most productive scholarly careers in intellectual history.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Eight-Wing: The Ox That Would Not Yield</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Eight-wing (w8)</strong> gives the self-preservation Nine a strength barely visible beneath its calm surface until a line is crossed. When the young Thomas wanted to join the mendicant Dominican order against his noble family's fierce opposition, his own brothers had him kidnapped and held captive in the family castle for over a year to make him change his mind.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">According to tradition, they even sent a prostitute to his chamber to tempt him into breaking his vow of chastity. Thomas is said to have driven her from the room with a burning log from the fireplace and then drawn a cross on the charred door of his chamber. For a year the family held him captive &ndash; for a year the dumb ox remained unmoved in his decision, until they finally let him go. This is the Eight-wing of the SP9: no loud rebellion, but a resistance that simply cannot be broken.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Summa Theologica: Order as Life's Work</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Thomas's major work, the "Summa Theologica," is a structure of immense scale: organized into questions, objections, and answers, it attempts to translate the entirety of Christian doctrine, together with the logic of the rediscovered Aristotle (SE1w9), into a single, contradiction-free system. This synthesis of ancient reason and Christian revelation &ndash; known as Thomism &ndash; became the defining framework of Catholic theology for centuries.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The same systematic force flowed, more than a century later, into one of the most important works in world literature: Dante Alighieri (SX4w5) built the theological architecture of his "Divine Comedy" substantially on Thomistic thought. The calm, methodical elephant from Aquino thus unknowingly supplied the intellectual foundation for one of the most passionate literary works of the Middle Ages.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Light and Shadow</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of SP9w8 shows in the ability to combine unshakeable inner calm with tremendous creative force: Thomas left behind a body of work of such magnitude that the Catholic Church canonized him in 1323 and, centuries later in 1567, named him a Doctor of the Church &ndash; one of the highest honors the Church grants for theological work.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The shadow lies in the Nine's fate pattern, sloth: where order becomes an end in itself, it can also harden into rigidity &ndash; in later centuries, Thomism was at times narrowed into dogma and defended against exactly the openness to new knowledge that Thomas himself had risked by incorporating the "pagan" Aristotle.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Legacy: The Ox That Fell Silent</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">On December 6, 1273, during Mass in Naples, Thomas experienced a mystical event after which he never again wrote a word of his "Summa Theologica." Asked by his secretary why he would not finish the immense work, he answered: "I can do no more. All that I have written seems to me like straw compared to what I have seen and what has been revealed to me."</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The elephant with the Eight-wing, who had spent his life building a vast structure of thought with unshakeable persistence, laid down his pen at the decisive moment &ndash; not from exhaustion, but because, thoroughly SP9, he recognized that behind all order lies a peace no system can capture. Thomas died a few months later, in March 1274, on his way to the Council of Lyon. The dumb ox had long since carried his bellowing into the world &ndash; and, in the end, fell silent of his own will before what lay beyond all words.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Wolf</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>wolf</strong> is the animal of the sexual Type 6 &ndash; an animal that does not avoid threat, but meets it head-on. Uwe Ochsenknecht showed this pattern in unmistakable form as early as age eleven: he ran away from home and spent a year in Spain &ndash; not a flight from fear, but a leap straight into uncertainty that he later described as decisive for his development.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The German actor Uwe Adam Ochsenknecht, born in 1956 in Biblis in southern Hesse, grew up in Mannheim, attended the Ludwig-Frank-Gymnasium, and began his stage career as an extra at the Nationaltheater. After training at the Westphalian Drama School in Bochum (1974&ndash;1977), engagements in Wuppertal, Munich, and Hamburg followed &ndash; a career path that was restless from the very start rather than straightforward.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Sexual Six: Plain Speech Over Retreat (Countertype)</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>sexual Six (SX6)</strong> is the countertype of the Six: it does not show fear through withdrawal, but meets it with strength, directness, and confrontation. Naranjo called this subtype <em>Strength</em> &ndash; the counterphobic Six that walks toward the threat instead of avoiding it.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This readiness for confrontation runs through Ochsenknecht's personal life: his nearly two-decade marriage to Natascha Ochsenknecht &ndash; entered in 1993, separated in 2009, divorced in 2012 &ndash; did not end in quiet distance but in publicly fought-out sharpness. His relationship with daughter Cheyenne, too, has for years been marked by open, publicly voiced grievances on both sides. For the sexual Six, conflict is not something to be smoothed over &ndash; it is faced directly, even at high personal cost.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Seven-Wing: Restless Versatility</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Seven-wing</strong> gives the sexual Six a quality an SX6 with a weaker Seven wing would not have: an appetite for the new, a pull toward ever-different terrain instead of settling into one proven role. Ochsenknecht's filmography spans more than 175 film and television productions across nearly every genre.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">His first major breakthrough came in 1981 as boatswain Lamprecht in Wolfgang Petersen's cult film <em>Das Boot</em>; real international success followed in 1985 with the lead role in Doris Dörrie's comedy <em>Männer</em>, for which he received the German Film Award in Gold. But Ochsenknecht did not stay with comedy: from the early 1990s he also stood on stage as a musician, as singer of the band "The Screen" with several released albums, and in 2010 with <em>Hairspray</em> and 2012 with Peter Maffay's <em>Tabaluga</em> he additionally moved into musical theater &ndash; each new field entered with the same appetite that first sent him to Spain at eleven.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. Light and Shadow</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SX6w7 is the ability to keep reinventing oneself across decades &ndash; from serious war drama to broad comedy, from film to music to musical theater &ndash; without ever settling permanently into a single, safe niche. Ochsenknecht has held his place in German entertainment for over four decades through exactly this restless versatility.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The shadow of the SX6 shows in its uncompromising nature: what begins as honest directness can, in the closest relationships, tip into open, public conflict that leaves little room for reconciliation. The ongoing estrangement from daughter Cheyenne and the sharp public reckoning with the failed marriage to Natascha show how high the price of this intensity can be within one's own family.</p>

        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The Owl is the animal of the Self-Preservation Type 5 – an animal that does not hunt in open expanses but in detail. It sees the single movement in the dark that others miss, because they cannot hold still that long. And it builds its territory not out of noise, but out of precision.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Xu Bing was born in 1955 in Chongqing and grew up at Peking University, where his father headed the history department – until the Cultural Revolution destroyed the family and sent the young Xu Bing into forced labor in the countryside. This experience did not become a rupture, but a method: he began collecting, copying, studying words and characters, as if language itself were a place one could fortify oneself in while the world outside collapsed. The Owl that, in a time of greatest exposure, learned to retreat into the silence of the character.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Self-Preservation Five: The Castle Made of Characters</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The Self-Preservation Five (SP5) is, according to Naranjo, the subtype he named "Castle": one's own territory – here not house or land, but one's own craft, one's own system – becomes a fortress against being overwhelmed. The passion of Type Five is avarice – the hoarding of energy, time and attention, so nothing is lost before it is fully understood.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Xu Bing's most famous work, Tianshu ("Book from the Sky", 1987–1991), is perhaps the most radical artist's castle of the present day: for more than four years he hand-carved over four thousand characters – each one invented, none of them exists in the Chinese language, yet each one is entirely correct in stroke order and structure, so that it looks genuine. He printed them onto endless scrolls and sheets that filled an entire exhibition hall – a work that looks like a book thousands of years old, yet no one can read it, not even a native speaker. The castle here was literal: a system no one could enter but himself.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">These four years alone at a workbench, carving printing blocks for characters that were not permitted to carry meaning – that is the avarice of the Five in its rawest form: work in which energy does not flow outward until it has been thought through to the very last consequence.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Four-Wing: Meaning as Loss</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The Four-wing (w4) gives the Self-Preservation Five a sense for the unique, the unmistakable, for what is more than mere information. The pure SP5 might have archived knowledge. The Four-wing asks beyond that: What does it mean when meaning itself disappears?</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Tianshu is not only a technical masterpiece – it is an existential statement about language, authority and loss. In China, where characters had for millennia carried knowledge, power and culture, Xu Bing created a book full of characters that look exactly like meaning – and yet are entirely empty. The Four-wing reads in this the grief over a culture whose language was devalued, falsified, instrumentalized by political upheavals. A work as precise as a dictionary – and as melancholic as a requiem.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Later he developed Square Word Calligraphy: English words forced into the shape of Chinese characters, so that Westerners suddenly have to learn what it feels like to decipher a foreign script. The Four-wing reverses the perspective – not to lecture, but to share the experience of foreignness itself.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Work: From Beijing to New York and Back</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">In 1990 Xu Bing moved to the United States after Tianshu had been classified as politically suspect in China due to its supposed ambiguity. In New York he developed his work further: A Book from the Ground (2003–2014), a novel composed entirely of internationally understandable pictograms – emojis, logos, traffic signs – readable without knowledge of any national language. With this he mirrored Tianshu: instead of a script no one understands, a script everyone understands.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In 2008 he received the MacArthur Fellowship – the so-called "genius grant" – and that same year returned to China to become vice president of the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing. His later installations, such as Background Story, use dust, rubbish and plant remnants behind frosted glass to create monumental landscape paintings in the style of classical Chinese ink painting – visible only as shadow, invisible in their true materiality. Always the same principle: something elaborate, hidden, that reveals itself only to those who look closely enough.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Each of his major works required years of preparation, often carried out in near-total seclusion, with assistants but without public intermediate steps. The world saw only the finished work – never the process. That is the SP5w4 in its most productive form: presenting a result so thoroughly thought through that no one suspects the years of solitude behind it.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Light and Shadow: The Owl in the Forest of Signs</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SP5w4 lies in its ability to create works of universal reach out of radical seclusion. Xu Bing has said more about language, power and meaning with invented characters than most have said with real words. That is the gift of the Owl: in self-chosen darkness, a clarity emerges that would not be possible amid noise.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The core passion of the Five is avarice – in the SP5 it shows as a tendency to keep away from the public for years, not to share the process, to release energy only once nothing is vulnerable anymore. Xu Bing's four years carving Tianshu, his emigration after political suspicion, his retreat into ever new, hermetic systems – that is the castle that protects, but also separates.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The Four-wing can tip the search for uniqueness into isolation – a work so personal and so encoded that almost no one can follow it anymore. In Xu Bing this remained productive because he made the encoding itself the subject – the impossibility of understanding became the message, not the obstacle.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Owl That Invented a Script for Everyone</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The healing path of the Five leads from the question "Have I understood enough to show myself?" to the realization "What is understood becomes more valuable when it reaches others." For the SP5w4, this means not abandoning the castle, but making its walls permeable – shaping the unique so that it no longer only mirrors one's own solitude, but becomes a bridge to others.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This is exactly the step Xu Bing took with A Book from the Ground: from a script that deliberately no one could read, to a script that literally everyone can read, regardless of language, education or origin. The Owl that first invented a language only for itself ended up inventing a language for the entire world.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Xu Bing today lives and works between Beijing and New York. His work hangs in the world's most important museums – from the Museum of Modern Art to the Victoria and Albert Museum. That is the Self-Preservation Five with a Four-wing. That is the Owl that turned silence into a new language.</p>

        <p class="krim-portrait-subtitle">Philosopher and writer, 1905&ndash;1980, born in Paris &ndash; Animal correspondence: Chihuahua</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Chihuahua With the Wandering Gaze</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Chihuahua</strong> is the animal of the sexual Four &ndash; small in stature, but carrying an intensity wildly out of proportion to its size, and a wariness that never quite lets it rest. At age three, Sartre fell severely ill with the flu, which left a scar on the cornea of his right eye and rendered him nearly blind in it &ndash; over the years, the blind eye visibly drifted outward, giving him the distinctive strabismus that later became his unmistakable trademark.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Born in 1905 in Paris, an only child, Sartre lost his father in infancy and grew up in his maternal grandfather's house, surrounded by books and intellectual expectation. Even as a child, he developed the conviction that he was no ordinary child &ndash; a perception his wandering gaze only reinforced. The Chihuahua, whose appearance set him apart from others, early made that difference a source of inner meaning.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. Sexual Four: Rivalry Against Every Bourgeois Convention</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>sexual Four (SX4)</strong> searches for the one connection, the one truth that outshines everything else &ndash; and at the same time rebels against any external form that threatens to constrain that intensity. Naranjo called this subtype <em>Rivalry</em>: a constant, often unconscious struggle against anything that presents itself as a given, foreign order.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In 1929 Sartre met Simone de Beauvoir &ndash; the beginning of a connection lasting more than five decades, which he explicitly refused to understand as a "bourgeois marriage," living it instead as an open partnership built on mutual intellectual rivalry and recognition, in which both sides also pursued other relationships. This radical refusal to submit to a socially prescribed form ran through his entire life: in 1964 he became the first person ever to decline the Nobel Prize in Literature, arguing that a writer must not allow himself to be transformed into an institution. The SX4 does not fight institutions in the abstract &ndash; it fights because any externally imposed form feels like an attack on its own unmistakable truth.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Five-Wing: The Struggle as a Philosophical System</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Five-wing (w5)</strong> gives the sexual Four the analytical sharpness not merely to live through its own burning struggle, but to translate it into a fully worked-out structure of thought. In 1943 Sartre published "Being and Nothingness," his major philosophical work &ndash; more than 700 pages that frame consciousness as radical freedom and as a constant struggle with its own nothingness, built on Kant (SO6w5), Hegel (SO5w6), Kierkegaard (SE2w1), Husserl, and Heidegger, yet condensed into a distinct system of his own.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The Five-wing also showed in the capacity for withdrawal with which Sartre worked on his oeuvre for decades &ndash; often fueled by amphetamines to sustain the concentration needed for hours-long, solitary writing sessions. What a pure SX4 lives through as raw intensity, the Five-wing turned in Sartre into one of the most influential philosophical systems of the 20th century.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Crabs of Le Havre and the Escape From the POW Camp</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">In 1935 Sartre experimented with mescaline &ndash; a single trip whose aftereffects pursued him for nearly a year: he repeatedly saw himself surrounded by imaginary crabs that accompanied his every step. Rather than repress the episode, he later processed it literarily in his play "The Condemned of Altona" &ndash; the hallucinated threat became raw material for a work, exactly as is typical of the sexual Four.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In 1940 Sartre was taken prisoner of war by the Germans. It was precisely his blind, wandering eye &ndash; which had actually been a hindrance &ndash; that spared him forced labor and, under the pretext of needing ophthalmological treatment, got him a pass out of the camp; he used it to escape and never returned. What had begun as a flaw became a tool of self-liberation.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Light and Shadow of the Sexual Four</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SX4w5 shows in Sartre's ability to build, out of radical personal freedom, an entire philosophy that shaped millions of people in the 20th century &ndash; the conviction that human beings are "condemned to be free" and must reinvent themselves in every moment. Politically too, he refused any comfortable allegiance, positioning himself throughout his life against colonialism and for society's marginalized.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The fate pattern of the Four is <strong>envy</strong> &ndash; in the SX4 turned into a permanent rivalry against any authority, any convention that seems to deny her own uniqueness. In Sartre, the shadow showed in decades of excessive alcohol, nicotine, and amphetamine use that significantly damaged his health, as well as in a restlessness that never let him find inner peace &ndash; there was always another fight, another work, another position to be taken.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Chihuahua Whom 50,000 People Paid Their Last Respects</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The healing path of the Four leads from the question <em>Why do I lack what others have?</em> to the insight <em>I am already complete, without having to assert myself against others.</em> For the SX4w5, this path shows itself as the restless struggle against every given form transforming into a sustaining, self-derived certainty &ndash; no less intense, but no longer driven by pure defense.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Sartre died on April 15, 1980, in Paris. A few days later, more than 50,000 people lined the streets of Paris to pay their last respects as his coffin made its way to the Montparnasse cemetery &ndash; a spontaneous, unplanned procession of mourning for a man who had rejected every institution throughout his life. The Chihuahua whose wandering gaze had once set him apart from others had, in the end, created a way of seeing the world that millions of people made their own.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The raccoon who worked unnoticed for twelve years before the world took notice</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>raccoon</strong> is the animal of the self-preservation Three &ndash; inconspicuous, skillful, persistent behind the scenes, without any need for the spotlight. Rosa Parks, born in 1913 in Tuskegee, Alabama, is still often reduced to a single moment: December 1, 1955, when she refused to give up her bus seat to a white passenger, sparking the Montgomery Bus Boycott.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">What is almost always overlooked: at that point she had already been secretary of the Montgomery NAACP chapter for twelve years, had recently attended the Highlander Folk School &ndash; a training center for civil rights work &ndash; and had personally investigated cases of racial violence, including the rape of Recy Taylor in 1944. Her refusal was the consequence of years of quiet, disciplined groundwork, not a spontaneous impulse.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The self-preservation Three: competence over glamour, even after world fame</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">According to Naranjo, the <strong>self-preservation Three (SP3)</strong> is the countertype of the Three: instead of self-promotion, it shows modesty, groundedness, a deliberate avoidance of the spotlight &ndash; while the underlying energy remains the same as in the other Three subtypes. Rosa Parks avoided the big stage throughout her life, even after becoming a global icon: hardly any sweeping speeches, no self-marketing, instead over twenty years of quiet work in the office of Congressman John Conyers in Detroit.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">She herself repeatedly stressed that she had not been physically tired that day, as the popular legend tells it, but "tired of giving in." That is the typical SP3 stance: substance and actual conviction matter more than the public story told about them.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro"><strong>Distinguishing from the Self-Preservation Two:</strong> Given her decades of work for others &ndash; investigating violent crimes, later mentoring young people &ndash; one might be tempted to see a Self-Preservation Two in Parks, seeking meaning and closeness through personal care. The decisive difference lies in the direction of that care: the Two typically seeks its own indispensability within concrete, personal relationships; Parks' engagement, by contrast, aimed at an abstract collective &ndash; civil rights for an entire population, not care for individual people close to her. She also largely lacks the Two's typical, mostly covert conviction of her own indispensability: she always insisted she had been only one part of a far larger movement, rather than seeing herself as its central figure. And the central act itself was a matter of her own dignity ("I was tired of giving in") &ndash; a statement about the self, not about relationship or being there for others.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Four-wing: a matter of personal dignity, not strategy</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Four-wing (w4)</strong> gives the self-preservation Three a depth beyond mere practicality &ndash; a question of one's own, non-negotiable identity. Parks never explained her refusal as strategic calculation, but as personal: it was about her dignity, about staying true to herself instead of continually being humiliated.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">At her arrest she remained calm, composed, without drama &ndash; not loud confrontation, but a quiet, unshakeable steadfastness that came from a deeply felt personal conviction, not from a desire for attention.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. Light and shadow</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SP3w4 is its ability to <strong>act with quiet substance at the decisive moment, built on years of unnoticed preparation</strong> &ndash; the 381-day Montgomery Bus Boycott that her refusal triggered is considered one of the turning points of the American civil rights movement.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The shadow of the self-preservation Three with a Four-wing shows in how much one's own achievement can vanish behind the public myth: Parks and her husband lost their jobs after the boycott, received death threats, and had to flee Montgomery for Detroit in 1957 &ndash; while the public narrative increasingly reduced her to the "tired woman on the bus," rather than seeing the decades-long activist behind her.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Fifty years of quietly continuing the same work</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">It is telling for the self-preservation Three that Parks did not settle into the role of icon after the world-famous event, but simply continued her inconspicuous, disciplined work: decades in civil rights work, in Conyers' office, and in 1987 the founding of the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development, which supported young people &ndash; not a spectacular new beginning, but the same quiet persistence in a new form.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Her deep religious faith as a member of the African Methodist Episcopal Church accompanied her through this entire, decades-long work &ndash; another expression of the quiet, unspectacular substance that needed no outside confirmation to endure.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The raccoon whose quiet consistency set a movement in motion</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">What Rosa Parks leaves behind is a counter-model to the common idea of heroism: not a loud rebellion, but a quiet conviction grown over years, discharged in a single, calm "no" &ndash; which she then continued for fifty more years in concrete work, without any claim to fame.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Her archetypal animal, the raccoon, fits the story exactly: out of apparent nothing &ndash; a single, quiet act of refusal &ndash; she set a functioning, world-changing system into motion, without ever claiming the stage for herself.</p>

        <p class="krim-portrait-typ">SX6w5 &middot; Sexual Type 6 with Five-wing</p>
        <p class="krim-portrait-subtitle">Singer, songwriter &amp; producer, born 1986 &ndash; Animal correspondence: Wolf</p>
      </div>
      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Wolf Who Chose the Wilderness</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Wolf</strong> is the animal of Sexual Type 6 &ndash; an animal that does not manage its fear by retreating, but by facing the threat and growing from it. When Holly Brook Hafermann, still performing as "Holly Brook" in her teens, lost her first record deal &ndash; without management, without a lawyer, practically broke &ndash; she reached a point where she later said she might well have lost her mind, or even her life, had she stayed in Los Angeles. Her response was not therapy, not a break in familiar surroundings &ndash; but a cabin in the woods of Oregon, without heat, for a full year, chopping her own firewood and living off the land.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Out of that woman who deliberately exposed herself to hardship to find out if she could withstand it came "Skylar Grey" &ndash; a stage name she has explained herself: "Grey" stands for the unknown in life, something most people fear, whereas she considers herself "the complete opposite" &ndash; a deliberate turning toward uncertainty rather than fear of it. That is the wolf's nature exactly: not avoiding fear, but seeking it out, to prove one's own strength against it.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Sexual Six: Strength as Counter-Fear</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Sexual Six (SX6)</strong>, per Naranjo, is the <strong>countertype</strong> of the Six: instead of protecting herself from her own fear, she actively seeks it out to prove herself against it. Naranjo called this subtype <em>Strength</em>. Skylar Grey's withdrawal to Oregon was exactly this move &ndash; not an escape, but a self-chosen trial: no money, no heat, no distraction, no people pushing their opinions on her. Only the question of whether she could find herself again.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">She did &ndash; and with her came the line millions know without knowing who wrote it: the chorus of Eminem and Rihanna's "Love the Way You Lie" (2010), written shortly after her return from isolation. The SX6's counter-fear shows here not as aggression, but as a hard-won, hard-earned self-assurance that could only emerge after passing through the fear itself.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The same readiness to confront also shows in how Skylar Grey entered a shark tank of the music industry alongside figures like Eminem, Dr. Dre, and Diddy that has worn down bigger egos &ndash; and held her ground there not as a peripheral figure, but as an in-demand, independent voice.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Five-wing: Withdrawal as a Tool</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Five-wing</strong> gives the Sexual Six an additional pull toward withdrawal, distance, and work done in private &ndash; not out of weakness, but as a strategy: observe first, process, then act. In Skylar Grey this shows twofold: in the year of voluntary isolation itself, and in her preferred way of working as a songwriter. She has spoken openly about going utterly "blank" in collaborative writing sessions with others in the room &ndash; the pressure of having to be creative under observation blocked her so severely that she largely gave up that way of working.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Instead she prefers to write alone, and for years appeared behind the scenes for other artists rather than stand in the spotlight herself. The Five-wing gives the Six's fearlessness an analytical, introverted form: not the loud fight, but the quiet withdrawal out of which the actual strength arises.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Invisible Voice Behind the Hits</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">For years Skylar Grey wrote songs that made others famous without standing in the foreground herself &ndash; a pattern that fits the wolf's counter-fear: visibility carries vulnerability, and someone working in the background stays harder to attack for their own fear. Only as her confidence grew did she increasingly step forward as a singer herself &ndash; a process that took years and was repeatedly accompanied by the very fear that had once driven her into the Oregon woods.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The peacock that completely re-unfolded its own image</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>peacock</strong> is the animal of the sexual Type 3 – immediate, magnetic presence that resists calculation. In the 1990s and 2000s, Matthew McConaughey became the epitome of the charming romantic-comedy star, before completely reinventing himself from around 2011 with serious, physically radical roles – including losing over forty pounds for "Dallas Buyers Club."</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This transformation, dubbed the "McConaissance," earned him the 2014 Best Actor Oscar and shows exemplarily how completely this subtype can re-present itself without losing its own presence in the process.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The sexual Three: impact through immediate presence, not calculation</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>sexual Three (SX3)</strong> creates its effect not through calculated self-staging but through a presence that almost no one can resist. McConaughey's characteristic slow way of speaking, his unmistakable laugh, and his immediate stage presence in interviews and speeches – such as his widely quoted 2014 Oscar acceptance speech – show exactly this effect without visible effort.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">He shares this with Frank Schätzing (also SX3w4), whose public presence the life-pattern compass describes as never rehearsed but like a natural state: with McConaughey too, his own radiance never feels put on.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Four-wing: existential searching beneath the laid-back surface</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Four-wing</strong> gives the sexual Three an additional note of existential depth and a persistent search for one's own, authentic core. McConaughey's 2020 memoir "Greenlights" processes exactly this theme: an often unconventional, philosophically-spiritual self-examination that goes far beyond the usual Hollywood celebrity book.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">His role as Detective Rust Cohle in "True Detective" (2014), an investigator steeped in existential nihilism, also shows this combination of laid-back presence and abyssal philosophical depth – a role type that combined his relaxed Southern charm with genuine existential weight.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. Complete physical transformation for his own art</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">For his role as an HIV-positive electrician in "Dallas Buyers Club," McConaughey lost over forty pounds within a few months – a degree of physical devotion to a role reminiscent of the uncompromising completeness with which the sexual Three inhabits any stage it has committed to.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This radical transformation marked the beginning of a phase in which he systematically accepted only roles matching his new artistic standard – a deliberate, complete realignment rather than a gradual image change.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Light and shadow</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SX3w4 shows in McConaughey's ability to completely reinvent his public image without appearing implausible in the process – a rare combination of courage for radical change and retaining his own, unmistakable presence.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The shadow of the sexual Three shows in the fact that much of public perception remains tied to his earlier, more superficial image from the romantic comedies – an image against which he had to deliberately reposition himself with considerable personal effort.</p>

        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Matthew McConaughey's career shows the sexual Three with a Four-wing in one of its most striking forms: a brilliant public presence unafraid to completely re-appear in service of a deeper artistic truth.

      <div class="page-content">

        <h2 class="vb-section">1. The Sloth That Hid Under Other Faces</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>sloth</strong> rarely shows itself openly \u2013 it merges with its surroundings until it can barely be told apart from them. Fran\u00e7ois Damiens, born 1973 in Uccle, Belgium, began his career not in front of but behind the camera: between 1999 and 2005 he staged more than 400 hidden-camera pranks for Belgian television, almost always unrecognized himself, hidden inside a costume or character no one could mistake for his real self.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">To this day he is known as extremely reserved about his private life \u2013 his long relationship with his partner Ga\u00eblle stays deliberately out of the public eye, as do details about his two sons Jack and Jimmy. A man who constantly slips into other identities for work, but shields his own as thoroughly as possible.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Sexual Nine: Merging With the Role, Not the Fame</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Sexual Nine (SX9)</strong>, per Naranjo, does not seek her own stage presence, but complete absorption into a character or a moment. In Damiens this shows in his ability to vanish completely into any role \u2013 from the grotesque alter ego "Fran\u00e7ois l'Embrouille" to the broken, deaf father in 'La Famille B\u00e9lier' (2014), a role that brought him international recognition but never made him want to stage himself as a star.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">He also binds himself closely to his family circle rather than moving through the public spotlight: he even had his sons Jack and Jimmy appear in 'Le Prince Oubli\u00e9' \u2013 not to make them known, but because the line between his real life and his work is porous for him anyway.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Eight-wing: Confrontation as a Tool of the Trade</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Eight-wing</strong> gives the sexual Nine a readiness to confront that became Damiens' actual trademark. His hidden-camera alter ego was deliberately designed as "vulgar, grumpy, obnoxious, and unlikeable" \u2013 a character that provoked unsuspecting passersby and celebrities on purpose, until the situation tipped over. Not restrained humor, but direct, often uncomfortable confrontation as a comedic principle.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This very readiness to deliberately create uncomfortable situations rather than avoid them is unusual for the normally conflict-averse Nine \u2013 but typical of the Eight-wing. It gives the SX9's longing for merging a weapon: where a weaker Eight-wing withdraws, Damiens professionally sought out friction.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Work: From Hidden Camera to Character Actor</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">After his years as a covert camera provocateur, Damiens moved into cinema in 2006 with 'OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies' and the Belgian film 'Dikkenek.' In 2013, Katell Quill\u00e9v\u00e9r\u00e9's 'Suzanne' brought his first serious role change, playing the father of Sara Forestier and Ad\u00e8le Haenel \u2013 since then he has become one of the most sought-after character actors in French-language cinema, with over 50 films since 2000.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">This versatility, from grotesque provocateur to quiet, vulnerable father figure, shows both sides of the SX9w8: the ability to merge completely with a character, and the willingness to not shy away from uncomfortable, confrontational territory while doing so.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Light and Shadow of the Sexual Nine with Eight-wing</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SX9w8 shows in Damiens in the rare combination of actorly self-dissolution and professional courage to provoke \u2013 he shies away from neither grotesque comedy nor vulnerable drama, as long as both feel genuine.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The shadow of the Nine shows in the near-total shielding of his private life: where other celebrities put their relationships and family on public display, with Damiens almost everything stays unspoken \u2013 a form of self-forgetting that here does not discharge into passivity, but into professional dissolution, while the private stays nearly invisible.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Man Who Dissolves Into Every Role</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Fran\u00e7ois Damiens' path shows the sexual Nine with Eight-wing in a particularly versatile form: complete merging with whichever role he plays, paired with a readiness to confront that doesn't shy away even from uncomfortable comedic extremes \u2013 while his own life stays hidden as much as possible. The sloth shows itself to the world only as whatever it is currently playing, never as what it actually is.</p>

        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>dove</strong> often carries its deepest pain exactly where no one sees it – in the middle of ordinary, ongoing life. Mara Wilson, born in 1987 in Los Angeles, played the title role in "Matilda" at age nine while her mother was dying of cancer in the background. The diagnosis came during filming; her mother's death followed only months after the film's release – in the most public phase of her childhood.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">She later said of that time: "I felt completely lost, completely unmoored ... There was who I was before that, and who I was after that." And added, matter-of-factly: "My mother died when I was young, and I was filming all the time. I was all over the place. Acting was the one constant." No public breakdown, just quietly continuing to work through the greatest rupture of her life.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. Self-Preservation Four: A Deliberate Withdrawal Instead of the Continued Stage</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">According to Naranjo, the <strong>Self-Preservation Four (SE4)</strong> is the countertype of the Four: instead of displaying one's own suffering or remaining in the spotlight, a practical, often unspectacular consequence is drawn. Wilson ended her acting career in 2000 at age thirteen – just four years after "Matilda" – and deliberately chose against a life as a child star, because the fame had become too overwhelming to enjoy at that age.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Her own explanation stays understated rather than accusatory: she simply wanted "to be a normal kid." No spectacular break, just a quiet, final step out of the public eye and into college and a new, less visible life.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">3. The Five Wing: One's Own Story as a Literary Craft</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Five Wing</strong> gives the Self-Preservation Four an analytical, structuring note – one's own experience is not just felt, but systematically thought through and worked into literature. Wilson studied at New York University and in 2016 published "Where Am I Now?," a collection of personal essays about growing up in Hollywood and leaving it – followed in 2023 by "Good Girls Don't," an even more direct memoir.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Reflecting on childhood fame, she spoke with a sober, analytical distance rather than self-pity: "I don't think you can be a child star without there being some kind of lasting damage." This distanced, almost investigative stance toward her own past – experience becoming material for precise observation rather than mere complaint – is the classic Five Wing addition to the Four.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">4. The Work: From Matilda to Her Own Voice</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Before turning thirteen, Wilson had already played leading roles in "Mrs. Doubtfire," "Miracle on 34th Street," and "Matilda" – three of the defining family films of the 1990s. After deliberately leaving acting, she spent years building a second, quieter career as a writer and essayist, one that does not deny her earlier fame but reflects on it clearly.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Light and Shadow of the Self-Preservation Four with a Five Wing</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SE4w5 shows in Wilson's ability not to suppress an early, publicly experienced loss but to turn it, over years, into an independent, clearly reflected literary voice – distance as a path to truth, not an escape from it.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The shadow of the Four shows in the tendency to withdraw entirely from public life the moment it becomes overwhelming, rather than finding a sustainable middle position. The Five Wing can reinforce this withdrawal when precisely observing one's own story becomes the only way of meeting it.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Dove That Traded the Stage for Her Own Words</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Mara Wilson's path shows the Self-Preservation Four with a Five Wing in a particularly clear form: a loss suffered in the middle of the greatest public visibility, followed by a deliberate withdrawal into a quieter, self-directed second career. The dove doesn't leave the big stage out of weakness – it leaves to hear its own voice more clearly.</p>

        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>armadillo</strong> is the animal of the social Four: it doesn't seek its meaning in hiding but in a deliberately unadapted position within the community it feels it belongs to. Ole Nymoen was born in 1998 in Berlin, first completing training as a media designer at Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg before studying economics and sociology at Friedrich Schiller University Jena.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Instead of aligning himself with one of the established schools of economics, he oriented himself toward the Marxist theoretical framework of the journal "GegenStandpunkt" – a deliberately marginal, intellectually uncompromising position within his own field.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="vb-section">2. The Social Four: A Marginal Position Becomes a Public Voice</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>social Four (SO4)</strong> seeks its meaning in a visible, unmistakable position against a society whose consensus it simultaneously challenges. Since 2019, Nymoen has co-hosted the podcast "Wohlstand für Alle" ("Prosperity for All") with Wolfgang M. Schmitt, discussing economic history and political economy – their stated motivation: creating a counterweight to the "paranoid prophets" who achieve high click rates with simple explanations, while economic topics themselves remained underrepresented on the left.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">In 2025 he published the book "Warum ich niemals für mein Land kämpfen würde" ("Why I Would Never Fight for My Country"), which took a position against the prevailing societal tone in the middle of the debate on conscription and military readiness, sparking fierce controversy. Not adaptation to the zeitgeist, but a deliberate, publicly defended counter-position – the typical SO4 movement.</p>

        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The <strong>Five wing (w5)</strong> gives the social Four an analytically theory-building, more withdrawn side – unlike the image- and stage-oriented Three-wing variant. Nymoen's public presence is almost exclusively that of the analyst: a podcast on economic history, columns for "Jacobin," contributions to "Der Freitag" and "Wirtschaftswoche" – formats where the argument takes center stage, not the person.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">His book "Influencer: Die Ideologie der Werbekörper" (2021, with Schmitt) dissects exactly the phenomenon of self-staging that he himself consistently avoids – a typically SO4w5 distance from his own visibility, even as he becomes very publicly visible.</p>

        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The passion of the Four is called <strong>envy</strong> – for the SO4 a constant, painful comparison with a society that settles for simpler explanations while one's own, deeper truth remains uncomfortable. Nymoen's recurring theme – whether in influencer culture, economic history, or the question of war and national defense – is the refusal to fall in line with the obvious, majority-friendly narrative.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">Since February 2026, he has additionally streamed under the name "HeissaPapa" together with activist Simon David Dreßler on Twitch, analyzing political videos from the left-liberal spectrum – another new platform for the same underlying stance: publicly defending one's own, unadapted position again and again, rather than diluting it.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">5. Light and Shadow of the Social Four</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">The light of the SO4w5 shows in how a marginal theoretical position grew into a widely heard podcast and several bestsellers: "Influencer" reached the Spiegel bestseller list without ever giving up its own analytical distance.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">The shadow lies in the risk that deliberately distancing oneself from majority opinion becomes an identity marker in itself – the risk of seeking contradiction for its own sake, rather than continually testing one's own position against reality. For an SO4w5, telling genuine intellectual honesty apart from mere opposition remains a constant task.</p>

        <h2 class="vb-section">6. The Legacy: A Young Voice Against Comfortable Consensus</h2>
        <blockquote class="vb-blockquote">
          <p class="vb-intro">Ole Nymoen ranks among the youngest and, at the same time, most consistent public voices of his generation in German-language economic policy discourse – someone who didn't abandon his academic marginal position but built it into his own brand without smoothing it out for broader appeal.</p>
          <p class="vb-intro">From media-design apprentice to widely heard economics podcaster and book author: the armadillo didn't hide its shell but turned it into the instrument with which it keeps breaking open the comfortable certainties of its time.</p>
